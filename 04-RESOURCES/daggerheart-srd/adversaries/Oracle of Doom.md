﻿# ORACLE OF DOOM

***Tier 4 Solo***  
*A towering immortal and incarnation of fate, cursed to only see bad outcomes.*  
**Motives & Tactics:** Change environment, condemn, dishearten, toss aside

> **ATK:** +8 | **Psychic Attack:** Far | 4d8+9 mag

## FEATURES

***Terrifying - Passive:*** When the Oracle makes a successful attack, all PCs within Far range lose a Hope and you gain a Fear.

***Walls Closing In - Passive:*** When a creature rolls a failure while within Very Far range of the Oracle, they must mark a Stress.

***Pronounce Fate - Action:*** Spend a Fear to present a target within Far range with a vision of their personal nightmare. The target must make a Knowledge Reaction Roll. On a failure, they lose all Hope and take 2d10+4 direct magic damage. On a success, they take half damage and lose a Hope.

***Summon Tormentors - Action:*** Once per day, spend 2 Fear to summon 2d4 Tier 2 or below Minions relevant to one of the PC’s personal nightmares. They appear at Close range relative to that PC.

***Ominous Knowledge - Reaction:*** When the Oracle sees a mortal creature, they instantly know one of their personal nightmares.

***Vengeful Fate - Reaction:*** When the Oracle marks HP from an attack within Very Close range, you can mark a Stress to knock the attacker back to Far range and deal 2d10+4 physical damage.
