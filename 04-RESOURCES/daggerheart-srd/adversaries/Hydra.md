***Many-Headed Menace - Passive:*** The Hydra begins with three heads and can have up to five. When the Hydra takes Major or greater damage, they lose a head.

***Relentless (X) - Passive:*** The Hydra can be spotlighted X times per GM turn, where X is the Hydra’s number of heads. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.

***Terrifying Chorus - Action:*** All PCs within Far range lose 2 Hope.

***Magical Weakness - Reaction:*** When the Hydra takes magic damage, they become Dazed until the next roll with Fear. While Dazed, they can’t use their Regeneration action but are immune to magic damage.
