﻿# RED OOZE

***Tier 1 Skulk***  
*A moving mound of translucent flaming red slime.*  
**Motives & Tactics:** Camouflage, consume and multiply, ignite, start fires

> **Difficulty:** 10 | **Thresholds:** 6/11 | **HP:** 5 | **Stress:** 3  
> **ATK:** +1 | **Ooze Appendage:** Melee | 1d8+3 mag  
> **Experience:** Camouflage +3

## FEATURES

***Creeping Fire - Passive:*** The Ooze can only move within Very Close range as their normal movement. They light any flammable object they touch on fire.

***Ignite - Action:*** Make an attack against a target within Very Close range. On a success, the target takes 1d8 magic damage and is ignited until they’re extinguished with a successful Finesse Roll (14). While ignited, the target takes 1d4 magic damage when they make an action roll.

***Split - Reaction:*** When the Ooze has 3 or more HP marked, you can spend a Fear to split them into two Tiny Red Oozes (with no marked HP or Stress). Immediately spotlight both of them.
