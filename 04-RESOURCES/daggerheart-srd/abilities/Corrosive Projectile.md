> **Level 3 Sage Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 1

Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Far range. On a success, deal 6d4 magic damage using your Proficiency. Additionally, mark 2 or more Stress to make them permanently Corroded. While a target is Corroded, they gain a –1 penalty to their Difficulty for every 2 Stress you spent. This condition can stack.
