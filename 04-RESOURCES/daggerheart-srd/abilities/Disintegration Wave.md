﻿# DISINTEGRATION WAVE

> **Level 9 Codex Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 4

Make a Spellcast Roll (18). Once per long rest on a success, the GM tells you which adversaries within Far range have a Difficulty of 18 or lower. Mark a Stress for each one you wish to hit with this spell. They are killed and can’t come back to life by any means.
