﻿# SAGE-TOUCHED

> **Level 7 Sage Ability**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

When 4 or more of the domain cards in your loadout are from the Sage domain, gain the following benefits:

- While you’re in a natural environment, you gain a +2 bonus to your Spellcast Rolls.
- Once per rest, you can double your Agility or Instinct when making a roll that uses that trait. You must choose to do this before you roll.
