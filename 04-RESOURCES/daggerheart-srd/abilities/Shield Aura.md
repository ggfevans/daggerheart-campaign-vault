ï»¿# SHIELD AURA

> **Level 8 Splendor Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

Mark a Stress to cast a protective aura on a target within Very Close range. When the target marks an Armor Slot, they reduce the severity of the attack by an additional threshold. If this spell causes a creature who would be damaged to instead mark no Hit Points, the effect ends.

You can only hold Shield Aura on one creature at a time.
