ï»¿# VERSATILE FIGHTER

> **Level 3 Blade Ability**  
> **Recall Cost:** 1

You can use a different character trait for an equipped weapon, rather than the trait the weapon calls for.

When you deal damage, you can mark a Stress to use the maximum result of one of your damage dice instead of rolling it.
