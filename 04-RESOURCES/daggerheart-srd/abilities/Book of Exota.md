ï»¿# BOOK OF EXOTA

> **Level 4 Codex Grimoire**  
> **Recall Cost:** 3

**Repudiate:** You can interrupt a magical effect taking place. Make a reaction roll using your Spellcast trait. Once per rest on a success, the effect stops and any consequences are avoided.

**Create Construct:** Spend a Hope to choose a group of objects around you and create an animated construct from them that obeys basic commands. Make a Spellcast Roll to command them to take action. When necessary, they share your Evasion and traits and their attacks deal 2d10+3 physical damage. You can only maintain one construct at a time, and they fall apart when they take any amount of damage.
