﻿# BOOK OF ILLIAT

> **Level 1 Codex Grimoire**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

**Slumber:** Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Very Close range. On a success, they’re Asleep until they take damage or the GM spends a Fear on their turn to clear this condition.

**Arcane Barrage:** Once per rest, spend any number of Hope and shoot magical projectiles that strike a target of your choice within Close range. Roll a number of d6s equal to the Hope spent and deal that much magic damage to the target.

**Telepathy:** Spend a Hope to open a line of mental communication with one target you can see. This connection lasts until your next rest or you cast Telepathy again.
