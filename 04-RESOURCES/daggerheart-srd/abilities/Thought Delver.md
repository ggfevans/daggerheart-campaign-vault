﻿# THOUGHT DELVER

> **Level 5 Grace Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

You can peek into the minds of others. Spend a Hope to read the vague surface thoughts of a target within Far range. Make a Spellcast Roll against the target to delve for deeper, more hidden thoughts.

On a roll with Fear, the target might, at the GM’s discretion, become aware that you’re reading their thoughts.
