﻿# KNOW THY ENEMY

> **Level 5 Bone Ability**  
> **Recall Cost:** 1

When observing a creature, you can make an Instinct Roll against them. On a success, spend a Hope and ask the GM for one set of information about the target from the following options:

- Their unmarked Hit Points and Stress.
- Their Difficulty and damage thresholds.
- Their attacks and standard attack damage dice.
- Their features and Experiences.

Additionally on a success, you can mark a Stress to remove a Stress from the GM’s Fear Pool.
