ï»¿# FANE OF THE WILDS

> **Level 9 Sage Ability**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

After a long rest, place a number of tokens equal to the number of Sage domain cards in your loadout and vault on this card.

When you would make a Spellcast Roll, you can spend any number of tokens after the roll to gain a +1 bonus for each token spent.

When you critically succeed on a Spellcast Roll for a Sage domain spell, gain a token.

When you take a long rest, clear all unspent tokens.
