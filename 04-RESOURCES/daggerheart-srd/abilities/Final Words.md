﻿# FINAL WORDS

> **Level 2 Splendor Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 1

You can infuse a corpse with a moment of life to speak with it. Make a Spellcast Roll (13). On a success with Hope, the corpse answers up to three questions. On a success with Fear, the corpse answers one question. The corpse answers truthfully, but it can’t impart information it didn’t know in life. On a failure, or once the corpse has finished answering your questions, the body turns to dust.
