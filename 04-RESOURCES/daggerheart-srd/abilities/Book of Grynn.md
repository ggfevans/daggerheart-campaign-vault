ï»¿# BOOK OF GRYNN

> **Level 4 Codex Grimoire**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

**Arcane Deflection:** Once per long rest, spend a Hope to negate the damage of an attack targeting you or an ally within Very Close range.

**Time Lock:** Target an object within Far range. That object stops in time and space exactly where it is until your next rest. If a creature tries to move it, make a Spellcast Roll against them to maintain this spell.

**Wall of Flame:** Make a Spellcast Roll (15). On a success, create a temporary wall of magical flame between two points within Far range. All creatures in its path must choose a side to be on, and anything that subsequently passes through the wall takes 4d10+3 magic damage.
