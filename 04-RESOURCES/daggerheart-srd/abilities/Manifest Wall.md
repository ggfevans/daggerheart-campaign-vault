ï»¿# MANIFEST WALL

> **Level 5 Codex Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

Make a Spellcast Roll (15). Once per rest on a success, spend a Hope to create a temporary magical wall between two points within Far range. It can be up to 50 feet high and form at any angle. Creatures or objects in its path are shunted to a side of their choice. The wall stays up until your next rest or you cast Manifest Wall again.
