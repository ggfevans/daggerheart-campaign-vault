﻿# RANGER

Rangers are highly skilled hunters who, despite their martial abilities, rarely lend their skills to an army. Through mastery of the body and a deep understanding of the wilderness, rangers become sly tacticians, pursuing their quarry with cunning and patience. Many rangers track and fight alongside an animal companion with whom they’ve forged a powerful spiritual bond. By honing their skills in the wild, rangers become expert trackers, as likely to ensnare their foes in a trap as they are to assail them head-on.

## RANGER’S HOPE FEATURE

***Hold Them Off:*** Spend 3 Hope when you succeed on an attack with a weapon to use that same roll against two additional adversaries within range of the attack.

## CLASS FEATURE

***Ranger’s Focus:*** Spend a Hope and make an attack against a target. On a success, deal your attack’s normal damage and temporarily make the attack’s target your Focus. Until this feature ends or you make a different creature your Focus, you gain the following benefits against your Focus:

- You know precisely what direction they are in.
- When you deal damage to them, they must mark a Stress.
- When you fail an attack against them, you can end your Ranger’s Focus feature to reroll your Duality Dice.

## RANGER SUBCLASSES

Choose either the **[Beastbound](../subclasses/Beastbound.md)** or **[Wayfinder](../subclasses/Wayfinder.md)** subclass.

## BACKGROUND QUESTIONS

- A terrible creature hurt your community, and you’ve vowed to hunt them down. What are they, and what unique trail or sign do they leave behind?
- Your first kill almost killed you, too. What was it, and what part of you was never the same after that event?
- You’ve traveled many dangerous lands, but what is the one place you refuse to go?

## CONNECTIONS

*Ask your fellow players one of the following questions for their character to answer, or create your own questions.*

- What friendly competition do we have?
- Why do you act differently when we’re alone than when others are around?
- What threat have you asked me to watch for, and why are you worried about it?
