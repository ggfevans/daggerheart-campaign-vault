# CAMPAIGN FRAMES

A campaign frame provides inspiration, tools, and mechanics to support a particular type of story at the table.

Every campaign frame has a complexity rating that indicates how much its mechanics deviate from or expand upon the Daggerheart core ruleset.

Each campaign frame includes the following sections:

- A **pitch** to present to players
- Suggestions and guidance on **tone, feel, themes, and touchstones**
- An overview of the campaignâ€™s **background**
- Guidance for fitting **communities, ancestries, and classes** into the setting
- **Principles** for players and GMs to focus on during the campaign
- Unique setting **distinctions**
- An **inciting incident** to launch the campaign
- **Special mechanics** to use during the campaign
- **Questions to consider** during session zero

> *You can find each campaign frame map in the appendix of the core rulebook or at www.daggerheart.com/downloads.*
