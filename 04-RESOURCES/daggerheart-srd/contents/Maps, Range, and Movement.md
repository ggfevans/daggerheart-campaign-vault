# MAPS, RANGE, AND MOVEMENT

You can play Daggerheart using “theater of the mind” or maps and miniatures. The conversions below from abstract ranges to physical measurements assume 1 inch of map represents about 5 feet of fictional space.

Daggerheart uses the following **ranges** to translate fictional positioning into relative distance for the purposes of targeting, movement, and other game mechanics:

- **Melee:** Close enough to touch, up to a few feet away.
- **Very Close:** Close enough to see fine details, about 5–10 feet away. While in danger, a character can move, as part of their action, from Very Close range into Melee range. *On a map: anything within the shortest length of a game card (2-3 inches).*
- **Close:** Close enough to see prominent details, about 10–30 feet away. While in danger, a character can move, as part of their action, from Close range into Melee range. *On a map: anything within the length of a pencil (5-6 inches).*
- **Far:** Close enough to see very little detail, about 30–100 feet away. While in danger, a character must make an Agility Roll to safely move from Far range into Melee range. *On a map: anything within the length of the long edge of a piece of copy paper (11–12 inches).*
- **Very Far:** Too far to make out any details, about 100–300 feet away. While in danger, a character must make an Agility Roll to safely move from Very Far range into Melee range. *On a map: anything beyond Far range, but still within the bounds of the conflict or scene.*
- **Out of Range:** Anything beyond a character’s Very Far range is Out of Range and usually can’t be targeted.

Range is measured from the source of an effect, such as the attacker or spellcaster, to the target or object of an effect.

A weapon, spell, ability, item, or other effect’s stated range is a maximum range; unless otherwise noted, it can be used at closer distances.

> ***Optional Rule: Defined Ranges***
>
> *If your table would rather operate with more precise range rules, you can use a 1-inch grid battle map during combat. If you do, use the following guidelines for play:*
>
> *- **Melee:** 1 square*
> *- **Very Close:** 3 squares*
> *- **Close:** 6 squares*
> *- **Far:** 12 squares*
> *- **Very Far:** 13+ squares*
> *- **Out of Range:** Off the battlemap*

## MOVEMENT UNDER PRESSURE

When you’re under pressure or in danger and make an action roll, you can move to a location within Close range as part of that action. If you’re not already making an action roll, or if you want to move farther than your Close range, you need to succeed on an Agility Roll to safely reposition yourself.

An adversary can move within Close range for free as part of an action, or within Very Far range as a separate action.

## AREA OF EFFECT

Unless stated otherwise, all the targets of a group effect must be within Very Close range of a single origin point within your effect’s range.

## LINE OF SIGHT & COVER

Unless stated otherwise, a ranged attacker must have **line of sight** to their intended target to make an attack roll. If a partial obstruction lies between the attacker and target, the target has **cover**. Attacks made through cover are rolled with disadvantage. If the obstruction is total, there is no line of sight.
