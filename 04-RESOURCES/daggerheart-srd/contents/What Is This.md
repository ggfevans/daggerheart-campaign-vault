# WHAT IS THIS?

This is the Daggerheart SRD (System Reference Document). It is a repository of the mechanical elements of the Daggerheart system, edited and organized for clarity, conciseness, and quick reference.

You can use this SRD in several ways:

- To quickly look up Daggerheart’s rules-as-written during gameplay sessions.
- To ensure any homebrew content you create or publish conforms with Daggerheart’s core ruleset.
- To provide copy text made available by Darrington Press for your own publications under their Community Gaming License (www.darringtonpress.com/license).
- To better understand the mechanics of Daggerheart, absent the flavor and setting information, so you can bend or break them in the process of making your own content.

The Daggerheart SRD is not a replacement for the core rulebook, which contains setting information, additional examples of various gameplay elements, and tons of great advice for playing Daggerheart—not to mention gorgeous artwork and layout.

In short, it is Daggerheart, the system, boiled down to the bones—a lean and clean offering without all the flavor, style, and supporting material that makes the core rulebook such an evocative and enjoyable read. We hope this document proves useful to your table. Happy adventuring!
