# RUNNING AN ADVENTURE

## INTRODUCTION

The GM is responsible for guiding the narrative and roleplaying the world the PCs inhabit. This section provides you with advice for running Daggerheart: using the core mechanics; creating memorable encounters; planning exciting sessions; selecting, creating, and using GM moves; crafting a full campaign; running dynamic NPCs; and more.

These three sections provide a foundation to help you get the most out of this game. The “GM Principles” are your guiding star—when in doubt, return to these principles.

## GM PRINCIPLES

### BEGIN AND END WITH THE FICTION

*Use the fiction to drive mechanics, then connect the mechanics back to the fiction.*

### COLLABORATE AT ALL TIMES, ESPECIALLY DURING CONFLICT

*The PCs are the protagonists of the campaign; antagonism between player and GM should exist only in the fiction.*

### FILL THE WORLD WITH LIFE, WONDER, AND DANGER

*Showcase rich cultures, take the PCs to wondrous places, and introduce them to dangerous creatures.*

### ASK QUESTIONS AND INCORPORATE THE ANSWERS

*Ensuring that the players’ ideas are included results in a narrative that supports the whole group’s creativity.*

### GIVE EVERY ROLL IMPACT

*Only ask the players to roll during meaningful moments.*

### PLAY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS

*Be surprised by what the characters do, the choices they make, and the people they become.*

### HOLD ON GENTLY

*Don’t worry if you need to abandon or alter something that came before.*

## GM PRACTICES

### CULTIVATE A CURIOUS TABLE

*Follow what catches the players’ interest to foster an environment of creative inquiry.*

### GAIN YOUR PLAYERS’ TRUST

*Act in good faith, follow through on your promises, admit your mistakes.*

### KEEP THE STORY MOVING FORWARD

*Advance the story through escalating action, new information, or changing circumstances after every action roll, whether it succeeds or fails.*

### CUT TO THE ACTION

*Skip past the boring bits. When a scene drags on, end it.*

### HELP THE PLAYERS USE THE GAME

*Players have more fun when you help them understand the system.*

### CREATE A META CONVERSATION

*Empower players to speak out of character, use safety tools, and ask for clarification.*

### TELL THEM WHAT THEY WOULD KNOW

*Don’t hide obvious details or important information from the players.*

### GROUND THE WORLD IN MOTIVE

*An NPC’s actions flow from their goals and desires.*

### BRING THE GAME’S MECHANICS TO LIFE

*Set a good example of how fiction and mechanics work together to enhance the game experience.*

### REFRAME RATHER THAN REJECT

*If a player’s contribution conflicts with the fiction, work with them to reshape it.*

### WORK IN MOMENTS AND MONTAGES

*When framing a scene, decide which beats should be savored and which shouldn’t linger.*

## PITFALLS TO AVOID

### UNDERMINING THE HEROES

If a roll doesn’t go well, show how it was impacted by an adversary’s prowess, environmental factors, or unexpected surprises, rather than the PC’s incompetence.

### ALWAYS TELLING THE PLAYERS WHAT TO ROLL

Let the players decide how to handle a challenge.

### LETTING SCENES DRAG

Shake it up or cut away when a scene has concluded, the table’s energy is flagging, or people are talking in circles.

### SINGULAR SOLUTIONS

Don’t get hung up on one right answer to a problem. If the players have a clever idea, make it work.

### OVERPLANNING

Spend your prep time inventing situations instead of scripting scenes. If the players surprise you, take a break to think through your options.

### HOARDING FEAR

Spend Fear when you have the opportunity. The players will enjoy its immediate impact.
