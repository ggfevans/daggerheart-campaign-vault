# Adversaries Guide

## Adversary Stat Blocks

All the information required to run an adversary is contained in their stat block. An adversary's stat block includes:

### Name
Each stat block has a unique **name**. Abilities that affect adversaries with a certain name include all adversaries who use that stat block, regardless of their in-story name.

### Tier
Each adversary is designed to oppose PCs of a certain **tier**. If you confront the party with an adversary from another tier, adjust their stats.

### Type
The adversary's **type** represents the role they play in a conflict:

- **Bruisers**: Tough; deliver powerful attacks
- **Hordes**: Groups of identical creatures acting together as a single unit
- **Leaders**: Command and summon other adversaries
- **Minions**: Easily dispatched but dangerous in numbers
- **Ranged**: Fragile in close encounters but deal high damage at range
- **Skulks**: Manoeuvre and exploit opportunities to ambush opponents
- **Socials**: Present challenges around conversation instead of combat
- **Solos**: Present a formidable challenge to a whole party, with or without support
- **Standards**: Representative of their fictional group
- **Supports**: Enhance their allies and disrupt their opponents

### Other Elements
- **Description**: A summary of the adversary's appearance and demeanour
- **Motives & Tactics**: Suggested impulses, actions and goals for the adversary
- **Difficulty**: The Difficulty of any roll made against the adversary
- **Damage Thresholds, Hit Points, and Stress**: Function the same way they do for PCs
- **Attack Modifier**: Bonus or penalty applied to attack rolls
- **Standard Attack**: Primary mode of inflicting harm on the PCs

## Adversary Features

There are three kinds of adversary features:

- **Actions**: Special attacks or unique actions when spotlighted
- **Reactions**: Special effects when triggered, regardless of spotlight
- **Passives**: Abilities that remain in effect by default
- **Fear Features**: High-impact effects that cost a Fear to activate

### Common Feature Examples

- ***More Where That Came From***: Summon additional adversaries

**Reactions:**

- ***Arcane Form***: Resistant to magic damage

## Building Balanced Encounters

Start with **[(3 x number of PCs in combat) + 2] Battle Points** and adjust:

**Adjustments:**
- **-1** for easier/shorter fight
- **-2** if using 2+ Solo adversaries
- **-2** if adding +1d4 to all damage rolls
- **+1** if using lower tier adversary
- **+1** if no Bruisers, Hordes, Leaders, or Solos
- **+2** for harder/longer fight

**Adversary Costs:**
- **1 point**: Each group of Minions (equal to party size)
- **1 point**: Each Social or Support adversary
- **2 points**: Each Horde, Ranged, Skulk, or Standard adversary
- **3 points**: Each Leader adversary
- **4 points**: Each Bruiser adversary
- **5 points**: Each Solo adversary
