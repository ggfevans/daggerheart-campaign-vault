# GM Guidance

## Introduction

The GM is responsible for guiding the narrative and roleplaying the world the PCs inhabit. This section provides you with advice for running Daggerheart: using the core mechanics; creating memorable encounters; planning exciting sessions; selecting, creating, and using GM moves; crafting a full campaign; running dynamic NPCs; and more.

These three sections provide a foundation to help you get the most out of this game. The "GM Principles" are your guiding star—when in doubt, return to these principles.

## GM Principles

### Begin and End with the Fiction

*Use the fiction to drive mechanics, then connect the mechanics back to the fiction.*

### Collaborate at All Times, Especially During Conflict

*The PCs are the protagonists of the campaign; antagonism between player and GM should exist only in the fiction.*

### Fill the World with Life, Wonder, and Danger

*Showcase rich cultures, take the PCs to wondrous places, and introduce them to dangerous creatures.*

### Ask Questions and Incorporate the Answers

*Ensuring that the players' ideas are included results in a narrative that supports the whole group's creativity.*

### Give Every Roll Impact

*Only ask the players to roll during meaningful moments.*

### Play to Find Out What Happens

*Be surprised by what the characters do, the choices they make, and the people they become.*

### Hold on Gently

*Don't worry if you need to abandon or alter something that came before.*

## GM Practices

### Cultivate a Curious Table

*Follow what catches the players' interest to foster an environment of creative inquiry.*

### Gain Your Players' Trust

*Act in good faith, follow through on your promises, admit your mistakes.*

### Keep the Story Moving Forward

*Advance the story through escalating action, new information, or changing circumstances after every action roll, whether it succeeds or fails.*

### Cut to the Action

*Skip past the boring bits. When a scene drags on, end it.*

### Help the Players Use the Game

*Players have more fun when you help them understand the system.*

### Create a Meta Conversation

*Empower players to speak out of character, use safety tools, and ask for clarification.*

### Tell Them What They Would Know

*Don't hide obvious details or important information from the players.*

### Ground the World in Motive

*An NPC's actions flow from their goals and desires.*

### Bring the Game's Mechanics to Life

*Set a good example of how fiction and mechanics work together to enhance the game experience.*

### Reframe Rather than Reject

*If a player's contribution conflicts with the fiction, work with them to reshape it.*

### Work in Moments and Montages

*When framing a scene, decide which beats should be savoured and which shouldn't linger.*

## Pitfalls to Avoid

### Undermining the Heroes

If a roll doesn't go well, show how it was impacted by an adversary's prowess, environmental factors, or unexpected surprises, rather than the PC's incompetence.

### Always Telling the Players What to Roll

Let the players decide how to handle a challenge.

### Letting Scenes Drag

Shake it up or cut away when a scene has concluded, the table's energy is flagging, or people are talking in circles.

### Singular Solutions

Don't get hung up on one right answer to a problem. If the players have a clever idea, make it work.

### Overplanning

Spend your prep time inventing situations instead of scripting scenes. If the players surprise you, take a break to think through your options.

### Hoarding Fear

Spend Fear when you have the opportunity. The players will enjoy its immediate impact.
