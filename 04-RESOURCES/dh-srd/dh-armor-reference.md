# Armor Reference

## Armor Mechanics

- **Base Thresholds**: Major/Severe damage thresholds (add your level)
- **Base Score**: Armor protection value (add your level)
- **Features**: Special armor properties

## Tier 1 Armor (Level 1)

|----------|---------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Gambeson Armor | 5 / 11 | 3 | ***Flexible:*** +1 to Evasion |
| Leather Armor | 6 / 13 | 3 | — |
| Chainmail Armor | 7 / 15 | 4 | ***Heavy:*** -1 to Evasion |
| Full Plate Armor | 8 / 17 | 4 | ***Very Heavy:*** -2 to Evasion; -1 to Agility |

## Tier 2 Armor (Levels 2-4) - Examples

| **Name** | **Base Thresholds** | **Base Score** | **Feature** |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Improved Gambeson | 7 / 16 | 4 | ***Flexible:*** +1 to Evasion |
| Improved Leather | 9 / 20 | 4 | — |
| Improved Chainmail | 11 / 24 | 5 | ***Heavy:*** -1 to Evasion |

| Harrowbone Armor | 9 / 21 | 4 | ***Resilient:*** Roll d6 when marking last slot |
| Tyris Soft Armor | 8 / 18 | 5 | ***Quiet:*** +2 to silent movement |

## Common Armor Features

- **Flexible**: +1 to Evasion
- **Heavy**: -1 to Evasion  
- **Very Heavy**: -2 to Evasion; -1 to Agility
- **Warded**: Reduce magic damage by Armor Score before thresholds
- **Resilient**: Special protection when marking last armor slot
- **Quiet**: Bonus to stealth-related rolls
- **Reinforced**: Bonus to damage thresholds when armor is damaged

## Armor Progression

- **Tier 1 (Level 1)**: Basic armor for character creation
- **Tier 2 (Levels 2-4)**: "Improved" versions with better protection
- **Tier 3 (Levels 5-7)**: "Advanced" versions with unique features  
- **Tier 4 (Levels 8-10)**: "Legendary" versions with powerful abilities

## Armor Slots

Some armor has **Armor Slots** that can be marked to reduce incoming damage:
- Mark 1 Armor Slot to reduce damage by one threshold
- When armor slots are full, the armor provides no additional protection
- Clear armor slots during downtime or with special abilities

## Damage Calculation

Your actual damage thresholds = **Base Thresholds** + **Your Level**

Example: Level 3 character with Leather Armor
- Major Threshold: 6 + 3 = 9
- Severe Threshold: 13 + 3 = 16
