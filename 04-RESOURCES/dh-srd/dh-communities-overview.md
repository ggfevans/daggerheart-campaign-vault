# Communities

Communities represent a key aspect of the **culture, class, or environment of origin** that has had the most influence over your character's upbringing.

Your character's community grants them a **community feature.** Each community card also lists six adjectives you can use as inspiration to create your character's personality, their relationship to their peers, their attitude toward their upbringing, or the demeanour with which they interact with the rest of the party.

## The 9 Communities

- **Highborne** - Noble courts, aristocracy, refined society
- **Loreborne** - Scholarly institutions, libraries, centres of learning
- **Orderborne** - Military organisations, structured hierarchies, disciplined groups
- **Ridgeborne** - Mountain communities, highland settlements, rugged terrain
- **Seaborne** - Coastal towns, island communities, maritime culture
- **Skyborne** - Elevated settlements, aerial communities, sky cities
- **Underborne** - Underground societies, cave dwellers, subterranean culture
- **Wanderborne** - Nomadic tribes, travelling merchants, rootless folk
- **Wildborne** - Frontier settlements, untamed wilderness, natural communities

Each community provides both mechanical benefits through its feature and narrative inspiration through personality traits that help define how your character interacts with the world.
