﻿# WILD SURGE

> **Level 7 Sage Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

Once per long rest, mark a Stress to channel the natural world around you and enhance yourself. Describe how your appearance changes, then place a d6 on this card with the 1 value facing up.

While the Wild Surge Die is active, you add its value to every action roll you make. After you add its value to a roll, increase the Wild Surge Die’s value by one. When the die’s value would exceed 6 or you take a rest, this form drops and you must mark an additional Stress.
