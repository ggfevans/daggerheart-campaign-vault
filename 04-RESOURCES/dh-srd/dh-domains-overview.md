# Domains

The Daggerheart core set includes 9 Domain Decks, each comprising a collection of cards granting features or special abilities expressing a particular theme.

## The 9 Domains

- **Arcana** - Raw magical power and elemental forces
- **Blade** - Martial prowess and weapon mastery
- **Bone** - Death, decay, and necromantic magic
- **Codex** - Knowledge, learning, and scholarly magic
- **Grace** - Agility, finesse, and elegant movement
- **Midnight** - Stealth, shadows, and hidden arts
- **Sage** - Nature wisdom and primal magic
- **Splendor** - Divine power and celestial magic
- **Valor** - Courage, protection, and heroic deeds

## Domain Access by Class

Each class has access to exactly two domains:

| **Class** | **Domain 1** | **Domain 2** |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Bard | Codex | Grace |
| Druid | Arcana | Sage |
| Guardian | Blade | Valor |
| Ranger | Bone | Sage |
| Rogue | Grace | Midnight |
| Seraph | Splendor | Valor |
| Sorcerer | Arcana | Midnight |
| Warrior | Blade | Bone |
| Wizard | Codex | Splendor |

## How Domains Work

- **Character Creation**: Choose 2 domain cards from your class's domains
- **Leveling Up**: Gain 1 new domain card (at or below your level) each time you level up
- **Loadout Limit**: Maximum of 5 domain cards active at once
- **Vault System**: Store inactive cards in your vault; swap during rest or by marking Stress

Domain cards represent your character's growing mastery in their chosen areas of expertise, from magical spells to combat techniques to scholarly knowledge.
