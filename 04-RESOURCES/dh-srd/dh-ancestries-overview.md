# Ancestries

**Ancestries** represent your character's lineage, which affects their physical appearance and access to certain special abilities. The following section describes each ancestry in Daggerheart and the characteristics generally shared by members of that ancestry. However, each player decides how their character aligns with the "standard" or "average" expression of their ancestry.

In Daggerheart, the term "people" is used to refer to all ancestries, as individuals from all lineages possess unique characteristics and cultures, as well as personhood.

Some ancestries are described using the term **"humanoid."** This does not imply any genetic relation to "humans," which is a distinct ancestry within Daggerheart. Instead, it refers to the set of physical characteristics humans will recognise from their own anatomy, such as bipedal movement, upright posture, facial layout, and more. These traits vary by ancestry and individual, though "humanoid" should still provide a useful frame of reference.

## Ancestry Features

Each ancestry grants two **ancestry features.** While some features specify the anatomy of any player character of that ancestry's anatomy, players determine their characters' physical form. Work with the GM to re-flavour any implied traits that don't align with your character concept.

## The 18 Ancestries

- **Clank** - Constructed beings with mechanical features
- **Drakona** - Draconic heritage with scaled features
- **Dwarf** - Stout, resilient mountain folk
- **Elf** - Graceful, long-lived forest dwellers
- **Faerie** - Small, magical woodland creatures
- **Faun** - Half-human, half-goat nature spirits
- **Firbolg** - Giant-kin with nature affinity
- **Fungirl** - Mushroom-like fungal beings
- **Galapa** - Turtle-like aquatic people
- **Giant** - Large, powerful humanoids
- **Goblin** - Small, clever tricksters
- **Halfling** - Small, comfort-loving folk
- **Human** - Versatile and adaptable
- **Infernis** - Fiendish heritage with infernal traits
- **Katari** - Feline humanoids with cat-like features
- **Orc** - Strong, proud warrior culture
- **Ribbet** - Frog-like amphibious people
- **Simian** - Ape-like climbing specialists

## Mixed Ancestry

Families within the world of Daggerheart are as unique as the peoples and cultures that inhabit it. Anyone's appearance and abilities can be shaped by blood, magic, proximity, or a variety of other factors.

If you decide that your character is a descendant of multiple ancestries and you want to mechanically represent that in the game, use the steps below:

### 1. Determine Ancestry Combination

When you choose an ancestry at character creation, write down how your character identifies themself in the Heritage section of your character sheet. For example, if your character is descended from both goblins and orcs, you could use a hybridised term, such as "goblin-orc." To describe your ancestry, list only the ancestry you more closely identify with (e.g., just "goblin" or just "orc"), or invent a new term, such as "toothling."

### 2. Choose Ancestry Features

Work with your GM to choose two features from the ancestries in your character's lineage. You must choose the first feature from one ancestry and the second from another. Write both down on a notecard you can keep with your other cards or next to your character sheet.

> *For example, if you are making a goblin-orc, you might take the "Surefooted" and "Tusks" features or the "Sturdy" and "Danger Sense" features. You can't take both the "Surefooted" and "Sturdy" features because both are the first features listed on their respective ancestry cards.*

Your character's heritage might include more than two ancestries, but you still only choose features from two. You can represent additional ancestries through their appearance or backstory.
