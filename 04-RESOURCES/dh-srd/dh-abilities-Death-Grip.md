ï»¿# DEATH GRIP

> **Level 4 Sage Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 1

Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Close range and choose one of the following options:

- You pull the target into Melee range or pull yourself into Melee range of them.
- You constrict the target and force them to mark 2 Stress.
- All adversaries between you and the target must succeed on a Reaction Roll (13) or be hit by vines, taking 3d6+2 physical damage.

On a success, vines reach out from your hands, causing the chosen effect and temporarily Restraining the target.
