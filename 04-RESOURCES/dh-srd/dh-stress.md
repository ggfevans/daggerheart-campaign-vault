# Stress

**Stress** represents how much mental, physical, and emotional strain a character can endure. Some special abilities or effects require the character activating them to mark Stress, and the GM can require a PC to mark Stress as a GM move or to represent the cost, complication, or consequence of an action roll.

## Key Stress Rules

### When Stress is Full
When a character marks their last Stress, they become **Vulnerable** (see: Conditions) until they clear at least 1 Stress.

### Stress Overflow
When a character must mark 1 or more Stress but can't, they mark 1 HP instead. A character can't use a move that requires them to mark Stress if all of their Stress is marked.

### Clearing Stress
PCs can clear Stress by making downtime moves (see: Downtime). A PC's maximum Stress is determined by their class, but they can increase it through advancements, abilities, and other effects.

## Common Stress Uses

- **Activating special abilities** - Many domain cards and features require marking Stress
- **Domain card recall** - Swapping cards from vault to loadout costs Stress
- **GM moves** - Consequences of failed rolls or complications
- **Weapon features** - Some weapons require Stress to activate special properties
- **Environmental hazards** - Stress from dangerous situations

## Starting Stress

Every PC starts with **6 Stress slots** at character creation, regardless of class. This can be increased through advancement and special features.
