# Leveling Up

Your party levels up whenever the GM decides you've reached a narrative milestone (usually about every 3 sessions). All party members level up at the same time.

Daggerheart has 10 PC levels divided into 4 tiers:

> **→ Tier 1** encompasses level 1 only.  
> **→ Tier 2** encompasses levels 2–4.  
> **→ Tier 3** encompasses levels 5–7.  
> **→ Tier 4** encompasses levels 8–10.

Your tier affects your damage thresholds, tier achievements, and access to advancements.

## Step One: Tier Achievements

Take any applicable tier **achievements**.

- **At level 2**: Gain a new Experience at +2 and permanently increase your Proficiency by 1.
- **At level 5**: Gain a new Experience at +2, permanently increase your Proficiency by 1, and clear any marked traits.
- **At level 8**: Gain a new Experience at +2, permanently increase your Proficiency by 1, and clear any marked traits.

## Step Two: Advancements

Choose any two **advancements** with at least one unmarked slot from your tier or below. Options with multiple slots can be chosen more than once. When you choose an advancement, mark one of its slots.

### Available Advancements

- **Increase Two Unmarked Character Traits**: Choose two unmarked character traits and gain a permanent +1 bonus to them. You can't increase these stats again until the next tier.

- **Permanently Add Hit Point Slots**: Darken the outline of the next rectangle in the Hit Point section of your character sheet.

- **Permanently Add Stress Slots**: Darken the outline of the next rectangle in the Stress section of your character sheet.

- **Increase Your Experience**: Choose two Experiences on your character sheet and gain a permanent +1 bonus to both.

- **Additional Domain Card**: Choose an additional domain card at or below your level for your class's domains. If you've multiclassed, you can instead select a card at or below half your level from your chosen multiclass domain.

- **Increase Your Evasion**: Gain a permanent +1 bonus to your Evasion.

- **Take an Upgraded Subclass Card**: Take the next card for your subclass. If you have only the foundation card, take a specialisation; if you have a specialisation already, take a mastery. Then cross out this tier's multiclass option.

- **Increase Your Proficiency** *(Costs 2 advancements)*: Fill in one of the open circles in the "Proficiency" section of your character sheet, then increase your weapon's number of damage dice by 1.

- **Multiclass** *(Costs 2 advancements)*: Choose an additional class, select one of its domains, and gain its class feature. Add the appropriate **multiclass module** to your character sheet and take the foundation card from one of its subclasses. Then cross out the "upgraded subclass" advancement option in this tier and all other "multiclass" advancement options.

## Step Three: Damage Thresholds

Increase all damage thresholds by 1.

## Step Four: Domain Cards

Acquire a new domain card at your level or lower from one of your class's domains and add it to your loadout or vault. If your loadout is already full, you can't add the new card to it until you move another into your vault. You can also exchange one domain card you've previously acquired for a different domain card of the same level or lower.
