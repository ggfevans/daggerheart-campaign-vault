# Making Moves & Taking Action

Any time a character does something to advance the story, such as speaking with another character, interacting with the environment, making an attack, casting a spell, or using a class feature, they are making a move.

## Action Rolls

Any move where success would be trivial or failure would be boring automatically succeeds, but any move that's difficult to accomplish or risky to attempt triggers an **action roll**.

## Overview

All action rolls require a pair of d12s called **Duality Dice**. These are two visually distinct twelve-sided dice, with one die representing Hope and the other representing Fear.

To make an action roll, you roll the Duality Dice, sum the results, apply any relevant modifiers, and compare the total to a Difficulty number to determine the outcome:

- **Success with Hope:** If your total meets or beats the Difficulty AND your Hope Die shows a higher result than your Fear Die, you rolled a "Success with Hope." You succeed and gain a Hope.
- **Success with Fear:** If your total meets or beats the Difficulty AND your Fear Die shows a higher result than your Hope Die, you rolled a "Success with Fear." You succeed with a cost or complication, but the GM gains a Fear.
- **Failure with Hope:** If your total is less than the Difficulty AND your Hope Die shows a higher result than your Fear Die, you rolled a "Failure with Hope." You fail with a minor consequence and gain a Hope, then the spotlight swings to the GM.
- **Failure with Fear:** If your total is less than the Difficulty AND your Fear Die shows a higher result than your Hope Die, you rolled a "Failure with Fear." You fail with a major consequence and the GM gains a Fear, then the spotlight swings to the GM.
- **Critical Success:** If the Duality Dice show matching results, you rolled a "Critical Success" ("Crit"). You automatically succeed with a bonus, gain a Hope, and clear a Stress. If this was an attack roll, you deal critical damage.

> ***Note:*** *A Critical Success counts as a roll "with Hope."*

After resolving the action roll, the table works together to weave the outcome into the narrative and play continues.

## Failing Forward

In Daggerheart, every time you roll the dice, the scene changes in some way. There is no such thing as a roll where "nothing happens," because the fiction constantly evolves based on the successes and failures of the characters.

## Procedure

The following steps describe in more detail the procedure that all action rolls utilise:

### Step 1: Pick an Appropriate Trait

Some actions and effects specify in their description which trait applies to the roll; otherwise, the GM tells the acting player which character trait best applies to the action being attempted. If more than one trait could apply to the roll, the GM chooses or lets the acting player decide.

### Step 2: Determine the Difficulty

Some actions and features say in their description what the Difficulty is. Otherwise, the GM determines the Difficulty based on the scenario. The GM can choose whether to share the Difficulty with the table. In either case, the GM should communicate the potential consequences of failure to the acting player.

### Step 3: Apply Extra Dice and Modifiers

The acting player decides whether to Utilise an Experience or activate other effects, then, if applicable, adds the appropriate tokens and dice (such as advantage or Rally dice) to their dice pool.

> ***Note:*** *Unless an action, ability, or feature specifically allows for it, a player must declare the use of any Experiences, extra dice, or other modifiers before the roll.*

### Step 4: Roll the Dice

The acting player rolls their entire dice pool and announces the results in the format of "[total result] with [Hope/Fear]"—or "Critical Success!" in the case of matching Duality Dice.

> ***Example:*** *A player is making an action roll with a +1 in the relevant trait and no other modifiers; they roll the Duality Dice and get a result of 5 on their Hope Die and 7 on their Fear Die, then announce "I rolled a 13 with Fear!"*

### Step 5: Resolve the Outcome

The active player and the GM work together, along with the suggestions and support of the rest of the table, to resolve the outcome of the action.

## GM Moves and Adversary Actions

GMs also make moves. They should consider making a move when a player does one of the following things:

- Rolls with Fear on an action roll.
- Fails an action roll.
- Does something that would have consequences.
- Gives them a golden opportunity.
- Looks to them for what happens next.

After the GM turn is done, the spotlight goes back to the PCs.

Many adversaries and environments have **Fear features**, especially powerful or consequential moves that the GM must spend Fear to activate.

> ***Note:*** *This Fear is in addition to any Fear the GM has previously spent to seize the spotlight or activate another action or ability.*

## Adversary Actions

When play passes to the GM, the GM can make a GM move to spotlight an adversary. A spotlighted adversary can:

- Move within Close range and make a standard attack
- Move within Close range and use an adversary action
- Clear a condition
- Sprint within Far or Very Far range on the battlefield
- Do anything else the fiction demands or the GM deems appropriate

The GM can spend additional Fear to spotlight additional adversaries. Once the GM has finished, the spotlight swings back to the PCs.

## Special Rolls

Some rolls have unique specifications or otherwise modify the action roll procedure: trait rolls, Spellcast Rolls, attack rolls, and damage rolls. Unless otherwise noted, you can apply any bonus, modifier, or effect to a special roll as if it were a standard action roll.

### Trait Rolls

An action roll that specifies which character trait applies to it is called a **trait roll**. In the text of a feature or effect, a trait roll is referenced with the format "[Trait] Roll (Difficulty)" (e.g., "Agility Roll (12)"). If the text of an effect doesn't specify a trait roll's Difficulty, the GM sets the Difficulty based on the circumstances.

### Spellcast Rolls

**Spellcast Rolls** are trait rolls that require you to use your Spellcast trait. Your Spellcast trait, if you have one, is determined by your subclass.

Spellcast Rolls are only made when a character uses a feature that requires one. A successful Spellcast Roll activates the effect as described by the feature.

### Reaction Rolls

A **reaction roll** is made in response to an attack or a hazard, representing a character's attempt to avoid or withstand an imminent effect.

Reaction rolls work like action rolls, except they don't generate Hope or Fear, don't trigger additional GM moves, and other characters can't aid you with Help an Ally.

### Group Action Rolls

When multiple PCs take action together, the party chooses one PC to **lead the action**. Each other player then describes how their character collaborates on the task. The leader makes an action roll as usual, while the other players make reaction rolls using whichever traits they and the GM decide fit best.

### Tag Team Rolls

Each player can, once per session, initiate a **Tag Team Roll** between their character and another PC by spending 3 Hope. Both players make separate action rolls; before resolving the roll's outcome, choose one of the rolls to apply to both actions.

## Advantage & Disadvantage

Some features and effects let you roll with advantage or disadvantage on an action or reaction roll:

- **Advantage** represents an opportunity that you seize to increase your chances of success. When you roll with advantage, you roll a d6 advantage die with your dice pool and add its result to your total.
- **Disadvantage** represents an additional difficulty, hardship, or challenge you face when attempting an action. When you roll with disadvantage, you roll a d6 disadvantage die with your dice pool and subtract its result from your total.

Advantage and disadvantage dice cancel each out, one-for-one, when they would be added to the same dice pool, so you'll never roll both at the same time.

## Hope & Fear

**Hope** and **Fear** are metacurrencies representing the cosmic forces that shape the events of your table's story. Hope powers PC abilities and features, while Fear powers the abilities of the GM and the adversaries and environments they control.

### Hope

Every PC starts with 2 Hope at character creation and gains more throughout play. A PC can have a maximum of 6 Hope at one time, and Hope carries over between sessions.

Players can spend Hope to:

- **Help an Ally** - Roll an advantage die for another player's action
- **Utilise an Experience** - Add experience modifier to a relevant roll  
- **Initiate a Tag Team Roll** - Spend 3 Hope for combined PC actions
- **Activate a Hope Feature** - Use class-specific Hope abilities

### Fear

The GM gains Fear whenever a player rolls with Fear and can spend Fear at any time to make or enhance a GM move or to use a Fear Feature. The GM can have up to 12 Fear at one time. Fear carries over between sessions.
