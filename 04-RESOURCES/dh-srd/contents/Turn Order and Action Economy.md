# TURN ORDER & ACTION ECONOMY

Daggerheart’s turns don’t follow a traditional, rigid format; there is no explicit initiative mechanic and characters don’t have a set number of actions they can take or things they can do before the spotlight passes to someone else. A player with the spotlight describes what their character does and the spotlight simply swings to whoever:

1. The fiction would naturally turn it toward
2. Hasn’t had the focus in a while, or
3. A triggered mechanic puts it on

> *If your group prefers a more traditional action economy, you can use tokens to track how many times a player has had the spotlight: At the start of a session or scene, each player adds a certain number of tokens (we recommend 3) to their character sheet and removes a token each time they take an action. If the spotlight would swing to someone without any tokens, it swings to someone else instead. Once every player has used all their available tokens, players refill their character sheet with the same number of tokens as before, then continue playing.*
