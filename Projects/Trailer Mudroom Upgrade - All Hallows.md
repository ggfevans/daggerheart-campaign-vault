# Trailer Mudroom Upgrade - All Hallows

## Project Overview
Improving storage and electrical in the mudroom area of the All Hallows trailer

**Location:** Mudroom area next to fridges  
**Timeline:** TBD  
**Status:** Planning

## Scope
### Storage Improvements
- **Two-level shelf system**
  - Available height: 27.5 inches / 70cm
  - Width: 94.2cm 
  - Depth: 29cm
  - Shelf spacing: ~35cm apart for optimal use

### Electrical Upgrades
- **New outlet installation higher up**
  - Purpose: Battery charging station
  - Secondary use: Power for exterior light
  - Current power source: Outlet near fridges (lower level)

## Hardware Available
- ✅ One set of heavy-duty L-brackets (suitable for shelf support)
- ❌ Need: Additional brackets for second shelf

## Project Phases
1. **Phase 1: Electrical Work** (Priority)
   - Install new outlet higher up
   - Plan wire routing for exterior light capability
   - Complete before shelf installation for easier access

2. **Phase 2: First Shelf Installation**
   - Install lower/middle shelf using available brackets
   - Test functionality and spacing

3. **Phase 3: Second Shelf** (Future)
   - Acquire additional brackets
   - Install upper shelf
   - Final organization setup

## Design Decisions Made
- ❌ Dropped backpack hanging idea (risk of items falling behind fridge)
- ✅ Two shelf levels for maximum storage
- ✅ Electrical first, then shelving installation
