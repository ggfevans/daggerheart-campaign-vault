# Session 2 - Mire's End Crisis

## üìã Session Overview

**Date**: Friday, August 1, 2025  
**Duration**: 4:00 PM - [TBD]  
**Players**: Gareth, Andi, Carly, Mark, Luie  
**Setting**: Mire's End laketown investigation (The Soggy Boot tavern) ‚Üí [Continues based on party decisions]  
**Key Setup**: Dying pyre crisis, shambling townsfolk, critical expedition decision

---

## üéØ Session Opening: The Choice at Meyer's End

### Current Situation
- **Party Location**: Boat in Slithermarsh waters, observing Meyer's End
- **Immediate Crisis**: Central pyre burning faintly but **dying out** 
- **Ominous Signs**: Few townsfolk "shambling around" with zombie-like movement
- **Time Pressure**: One-month Shalk Chasm mission vs. immediate humanitarian crisis
- **Resources**: Meager supplies from Last Light, limited for detours

### Critical Decision Point
**Option A**: Investigate Meyer's End crisis (help dying settlement)  
**Option B**: Continue directly to Shalk Chasm (primary mission focus)  
**Option C**: Quick investigation then continue (compromise approach)

### Stakes for the Choice
- **Meyer's End**: Settlement may face catastrophe if pyre fails completely
- **Shalk Chasm Mission**: Delay could compromise month-long expedition timeline
- **Resource Management**: Limited supplies for extended diversions
- **Craven Vakvom**: Now confirmed hostile enemy, not rescue target

## üî• Meyer's End Investigation

### Initial Approach
[Document party's approach to the settlement]

### The Soggy Boot Tavern - CURRENT LOCATION
**Description**: Small sagging tavern of moss-eaten timber in Mire's End
**Atmosphere**: Somber tone - the townsfolk know the pyre is failing and sense impending doom
**Layout**: Features a stage area (potential performance space)
**Bartender Encountered**: Evasive local who gives cryptic responses, offers fish ale
**Patrons Present**: No one of particular note or danger (per Banjo's tactical assessment)
**Security Assessment**: Banjo surveyed room - all clear of immediate threats

**Key Interaction - Augustus & Bartender**:
- **Augustus's Question**: "Who is in charge of the town?"
- **Bartender's Response**: "Depends what parts of the town you are looking for"
- **Mechanics**: Augustus Presence roll FAILED (with Hope) - took stress
- **Result**: Bartender shut down, deflected to Vaerenth instead
- **Bartender to Vaerenth**: "Animals are not allowed inside unless on a plate" (referring to Hogpog)
- **Offered**: Fish ale to party
- **Implication**: Augustus's formal approach backfired - bartender now suspicious/unhelpful

**Current Party Actions**:
- **Banjo**: Received raw fish to eat, then planted fishbones in Jerry's pocket (rolled with Fear!)
- **Vaerenth**: Performed excellent original poem on stage - earned handful of gold and crowd approval
- **Performance Success**: Completely exceeded Jerry's terrible standards, lifted tavern mood

**MAJOR INFORMATION BREAKTHROUGH** (thanks to Vaerenth's performance):
- **Bartender opened up**: Recognized party as outsiders, shared crucial details
- **Pyre Crisis Details**: Wood doesn't help - adding more wood to the pyre has no effect
- **Key NPC - Davrinth**: Left town searching for a solution to the pyre problem
- **Local Blame**: Crowd/townsfolk blame Davrinth for the crisis (unclear why)
- **Authority Structure**: Townmaster is **Holya** - described as "the biggest woman"
- **Holya's Location**: Somewhere "in the middle of town" (specific location unclear)

**TAVERN BRAWL ERUPTS**:
- **Banjo's Mischief**: Fishbone planting in Jerry's pocket (Fear roll) backfired spectacularly
- **Chain Reaction**: Jerry spilled drink on Dracona named "Jeffrey"
- **Full Fight**: Tavern brawl broke out between patrons
- **Party Response**: Attempting to sneak out using Agility/Presence rolls
- **ESCAPE SUCCESS**: All party members succeeded their rolls (variety of Hope/Fear)
- **Current Status**: Party successfully escaped the chaos without being implicated

**HOPE/FEAR TRACKER**:
- **Player Hope**: 5 tokens
- **GM Fear**: 12 tokens (!!)
- **Momentum**: Fear tokens building dramatically - big complications incoming

**Information Gathered**: 
- Pyre crisis is magical/supernatural (wood doesn't help)
- Davrinth may be key to solution (but is blamed and absent)
- Clear local leadership (Holya) but location unknown
- Party needs to avoid association with tavern brawl

## üë• NPCs Encountered

### Holya - Townmaster
**Description**: "The biggest woman" - official authority of Mire's End, found in middle of town
**Leadership Style**: Protective, strategic - orchestrates deception for safety
**Current Crisis Management**: Coordinating response to supernatural pyre failure

**CRITICAL INFORMATION REVEALED**:
- **Davrith's Protection**: Public blame is "a ruse" - fake hostility to keep Davrith safe
- **Real Doubt**: Holya "not sure if Davrith is the problem" - suspects other causes
- **Current Mission**: Davrith went to "the ruins" last night (few hours away)
- **Overdue Return**: Normally safe travel, but Davrith hasn't returned yet
- **Crisis Timeline**: Pyre problems started "a few months ago"
- **Failed Solutions**: Davrith tried "many rituals, fuel" without success
- **No Evacuation Plan**: Holya "unsure" where people would go if pyre fails
- **Hidden Danger**: Something threatens Davrith's safety beyond public blame

**Key Questions from Party**:
- **Hart**: Where would people go if pyre fails? (Holya unsure - no backup plan)
- **Hart**: Have people traveled to ruins safely before? (Yes, normally successful)
- **Augustus**: When did pyre issues start? (Few months ago)

**HOLYA'S URGENT REQUEST**:
- **Implores party to find Davrith and get him back safe**
- Direct plea from townmaster for immediate rescue mission
- Confirms Davrith's safety is her top priority over solving pyre crisis
- Sets up critical decision: rescue mission vs. continuing Shalk Chasm expedition

**REWARD OFFERED**:
- **Produces an arcane prism** - magical gem as payment for rescue mission
- Holya acknowledges "it is not much good to them" - limited utility for Mire's End
- Significant magical item demonstrates value placed on Davrith's safe return

**PARTY DECISION MADE**:

- **Hart's grim determination**: "If he still breathes we will bring him back, if not..."

**Party Commitment**: Unified resolve to rescue Davrith or "do the right thing"

### MAJOR OBSTACLE: Destroyed Bridge Crossing
**Location**: Raging river crossing, 100 feet across
**Bridge Status**: DESTROYED - bridge is gone, no ropes reach across
**Water Description**: Black water rushing below in violent torrent
**Challenge**: No direct crossing method available

**PARTY SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED**:
- **Aster's Flight**: Could potentially fly across, but cannot carry larger party members
- **Size Limitation**: Some party members too large for Aster to transport
- **Alternative Routes**: [To be explored]

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Davrith's Camp**:
- **Vaerenth discovers**: Remains of a small abandoned camp on this side
- **Davrith's Premium Bedroll**: Embroidered with "Davrith's" name, clears 1 stress when used
- **Supply Cache**: Bag containing minor health potion and stride potion (hidden under tent)
- **Vaerenth's Action**: Collected all the gear from the campsite
- **Ominous Realization**: Party gets the feeling "he was never coming back"
- **Implication**: Davrith left gear knowing this was a one-way journey - suicide mission?
- **Hidden Potion**: Stride potion suggests Davrith planned for mobility/escape challenges

**ALTERNATIVE CROSSING ROUTE DISCOVERED**:
- **Small trail found**: Leads down to the water surface
- **Path description**: Trail goes down and across the river
- **Potential crossing method**: Underwater or surface-level route
- **Risk assessment**: [To be determined - black water dangers?]

**Environmental Details**:
[Document weather, visibility, alternative routes, other crossing methods]

**PARTY APPROACH - ROPE BRIDGE SOLUTION**:
**Strategy**: Span single long rope across ~110ft river for party to pull themselves across
**Group Action Roll**: Coordinated effort to generate Hope or Fear tokens

**EXECUTION**:
- **Banjo (Leader)**: Tied ropes together at two connection points - organized crossing attempt
- **Aster + Banjo Flight**: Aster succeeded Agility roll to fly Banjo across with rope
  - Banjo "flaps his long arms like wings" during flight - memorable character moment
  - **Critical Moment**: Banjo rolled 9 (nearly failed the crossing!)
  - **Aster's Prayer Dice**: Added +4 Prayer dice that saved the attempt
  - Successfully transported rope to far side for anchoring
- **Hart (Near Side)**: Successfully tied off rope at starting point - secure anchor established
- **Line Secured**: Both sides anchored, rope bridge established across black water torrent

**Group Action Result**: Success with dramatic tension - near failure saved by divine intervention
**Current Status**: Rope line secured across ~110ft span, ready for remaining party members to cross

**PARTY CROSSING SEQUENCE**:
**Crossing Strategy**: 
- **Hogpog (Biggest Challenge)**: Aster flying the mount across - most difficult crossing
- **Rope Support**: Banjo steadying the line from far side for manual crossers
- **Manual Crossings**: Party members pull themselves across using established rope

**Augustus Crossing**:
- **Banjo Support**: Rolled 22 with Hope - excellent rope steadying/guidance
- **Augustus Performance**: Succeeded his own crossing roll  
- **Result**: Safe crossing achieved with strong support coordination
- **Status**: Augustus successfully across, Banjo providing expert rope management

**Final Crossing - Hart & Vaerenth**:
- **Strategy**: Vaerenth piggybacks on Hart for final crossing
- **Hart's Strength Roll**: Rolled 20 - excellent physical performance carrying Vaerenth
- **Vaerenth's Presence Roll**: Rolled 18 - outstanding coordination/support during crossing
- **Result**: Exceptional teamwork crossing - both succeed with high rolls
