**Duration**: 4:00 PM - [TBD]  
**Players**: Gareth, Andi, Carly, Mark, Luie  
**Setting**: Meyer's End laketown investigation ‚Üí [Continues based on party decisions]  
**Key Setup**: Dying pyre crisis, shambling townsfolk, critical expedition decision

---

## üéØ Session Opening: The Choice at Meyer's End

### Current Situation
- **Party Location**: Boat in Slithermarsh waters, observing Meyer's End
- **Immediate Crisis**: Central pyre burning faintly but **dying out** 
- **Ominous Signs**: Few townsfolk "shambling around" with zombie-like movement
- **Time Pressure**: One-month Shalk Chasm mission vs. immediate humanitarian crisis
- **Resources**: Meager supplies from Last Light, limited for detours

### Critical Decision Point
**Option A**: Investigate Meyer's End crisis (help dying settlement)  
**Option B**: Continue directly to Shalk Chasm (primary mission focus)  
**Option C**: Quick investigation then continue (compromise approach)

### Stakes for the Choice
- **Meyer's End**: Settlement may face catastrophe if pyre fails completely
- **Shalk Chasm Mission**: Delay could compromise month-long expedition timeline
- **Resource Management**: Limited supplies for extended diversions
- **Craven Vakvom**: Now confirmed hostile enemy, not rescue target
