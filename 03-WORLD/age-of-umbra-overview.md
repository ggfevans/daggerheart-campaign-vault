# The Age of Umbra: World Overview

## üåë The Divine Betrayal
The Age of Umbra began a century ago when the **God-King Othedias betrayed the Pantheon**, provoking divine punishment and abandonment by the gods. This left the realm of the **Halcyon Domain** shattered, desolate, and eternally cursed. The gods have abandoned this world, leaving it to decay under perpetual shadow.

## ‚öîÔ∏è The Shadow-Choked World
### Current Reality
Throughout this **shadow-choked land of decaying fortresses and dreadful monstrosities**, surviving communities cling to hope in the face of lightless oblivion. This is a world where:

- **Nightmares rise**: Corrupted creatures born from fallen souls
- **Fortresses decay**: Ancient strongholds crumble under the curse
- **Hope is precious**: Small communities fight against extinction
- **Heroes emerge**: Survivors who dare to venture beyond the walls

### The Curse's Effects
The divine curse has fundamentally transformed the world:
- **Perpetual Darkness**: No natural light penetrates the curse
- **Corrupted Souls**: The dead do not rest, becoming twisted nightmares
- **Decaying Civilisation**: Great works crumble as the curse eats away at them
- **Divine Absence**: No gods answer prayers; mortals are truly alone

## üèõÔ∏è The Lost Halcyon Domain
Before the divine betrayal, this was the **Halcyon Domain** - a realm blessed by the gods. Ancient texts speak of:

- **Divine Favour**: Gods walked among mortals and blessed their endeavours
- **The God-King Othedias**: Once the greatest ruler, now the source of all suffering
- **Sacred Cities**: Temple-cities that channelled divine power
- **The Pantheon**: A complete assembly of gods who governed different aspects of life
- **Golden Age**: A time of prosperity, peace, and divine protection

Most of these have been destroyed, corrupted, or abandoned since the betrayal.

## üåç Current State of the World
### Survival Communities
Civilization has contracted into small, defensible settlements that can maintain light sources and defend against Umbral threats. These communities are:

- **Fortress Towns**: Heavily fortified with multiple light sources
- **Underground Cities**: Built in natural or artificial caverns
- **Lighthouse Settlements**: Coastal communities built around powerful beacon towers
- **Nomadic Caravans**: Mobile groups that keep moving to avoid Umbral buildup

### The Twilight Lands
Between settlements lie the **Twilight Lands** - vast stretches of shadow-touched wilderness where:
- Umbral creatures roam freely
- Reality becomes unstable
- Lost ruins hide ancient secrets
- Brave (or desperate) souls venture for resources and knowledge

## üîÆ Magic in the Age of Umbra
### Solar Magic (Diminished)
Traditional light-based and solar magic has been severely weakened. Solar casters must work harder for smaller effects, and many have turned to alternative power sources.

### Umbral Magic (Dangerous)
A new form of magic has emerged that draws power from the Eclipse itself. Umbral magic is potent but corrupting - practitioners risk losing themselves to the shadow.

### Lunar Magic (Enhanced)
Magic tied to the moon and stars has become more powerful, as these are now the primary light sources. Many communities rely on lunar mages for protection.

### Crystal Magic (Adapted)
Magical crystals that once stored solar energy have been adapted to capture and store whatever light remains, becoming incredibly valuable.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Threats of the Age
### Umbral Creatures
- **Shadow Wraiths**: Spirits consumed by darkness
- **Void Stalkers**: Predators that hunt in absolute darkness
- **Corrupted Beasts**: Animals twisted by Umbral exposure
- **The Hollow**: People who have lost themselves to the shadow

### Environmental Hazards
- **Shadow Storms**: Intense Umbral energy that can kill or transform
- **Light Drains**: Areas where illumination is supernaturally snuffed out
- **Temporal Rifts**: Places where time moves strangely
- **Whisper Zones**: Regions where the Eclipse seems to speak

### Human Threats
- **Umbral Cultists**: Those who worship the Eclipse
- **Resource Wars**: Conflicts over food, light sources, and safe territory
- **The Desperate**: People driven to extremes by the harsh conditions
- **Fallen Nobles**: Former leaders who've become tyrants or warlords

## üè∫ Lost Mysteries
### The Cause
No one knows what caused the Great Eclipse. Theories include:
- A failed magical experiment
- Divine punishment
- Invasion from another plane
- Natural cosmic phenomenon
- Ancient curse finally manifesting

### The Luminous Empire's Fall
The great civilization that once ruled here vanished mysteriously during the early days of the Eclipse. Their ruins hold:
- Advanced magical technology
- Possible solutions to the Eclipse
- Dangerous automated defenses
- Clues to what really happened

### The Eclipse's Intelligence
Some believe the Eclipse is not just a phenomenon but a **conscious entity** with its own agenda. Evidence includes:
- Coordinated Umbral creature attacks
- The Eclipse responding to certain magical rituals
- Whispers heard in the deepest shadows
- Patterns in how the darkness spreads

## üïØÔ∏è Hope in the Darkness
### The Lightkeepers
An order of dedicated individuals who maintain the light sources that keep communities safe. They are revered as heroes and guardians.

### The Scholars of Dawn
Researchers working to understand the Eclipse and find a way to end it. They seek ancient knowledge and conduct dangerous experiments.

### The Umbral Walkers
Those who have learned to traverse the Twilight Lands safely, serving as messengers, guides, and explorers between settlements.

### Signs of Change
Recent years have brought hints that the situation might not be permanent:
- New types of resistant crops
- Discovered methods of light enhancement
- Ancient prophecies speaking of "the return"
- Young people born during the Eclipse showing unique abilities



### The Sacred Pyres
The most important sources of hope and protection in the Age of Umbra are the **Sacred Pyres** - ancient ceremonial flames that have somehow resisted the Eclipse's influence. These magical fires burn with a pure, steady light that drives back both Umbral creatures and the corrupting effects of shadow magic.

#### Origins and Nature
The Sacred Pyres were originally created as part of religious ceremonies in the pre-Eclipse era, dedicated to various deities of light, protection, and renewal. When the Great Eclipse fell, most magical flames were extinguished or dimmed, but the Sacred Pyres not only survived - they grew stronger, as if drawing power from some divine or cosmic source beyond the Eclipse's reach.

Each Pyre burns with a unique colour and quality:
- **Golden Pyres**: The most common, providing warm light and protection from Umbral creatures
- **Silver Pyres**: Rarer flames that can cleanse Umbral corruption and heal the Changed
- **Azure Pyres**: The rarest, said to reveal truth and dispel illusions created by the Eclipse
- **Emerald Pyres**: Agricultural flames that help crops grow despite the perpetual twilight

#### Powers and Effects
The Sacred Pyres provide several crucial benefits to the communities built around them:

**Protective Barrier**: Each Pyre creates a radius of safety where Umbral creatures cannot enter. The stronger the Pyre, the larger this protective zone.

**Light Amplification**: Other light sources burn brighter and longer when near a Sacred Pyre, reducing the constant maintenance burden on communities.

**Magical Stability**: Spells cast within a Pyre's influence are less likely to fail or behave unpredictably, making magical healing and enhancement more reliable.

**Spiritual Comfort**: The flames provide hope and mental resilience to those who gather around them, helping resist despair and the psychological effects of the eternal twilight.

**Communication Network**: Some Pyres can be used to send messages to other Sacred Pyres across great distances, forming a vital communication network between isolated settlements.

#### Guardianship and Maintenance
Each Sacred Pyre is tended by a dedicated group called **Flame Wardens** - individuals who have devoted their lives to maintaining and protecting these crucial lights. Becoming a Flame Warden requires:

- **Spiritual Dedication**: A deep faith in the power of light and hope
- **Magical Sensitivity**: The ability to sense changes in the Pyre's condition
- **Physical Endurance**: The stamina to maintain constant vigilance
- **Community Trust**: Recognition by the settlement as worthy of this sacred responsibility

The Flame Wardens follow ancient rituals passed down through generations, though many of the original meanings have been lost. They know which materials feed the flames best, how to perform ceremonies that strengthen the light, and what signs indicate danger to the Pyre.

#### Threats to the Pyres
Despite their power, the Sacred Pyres are not invulnerable:

**Umbral Cultists**: Fanatics who serve the Eclipse actively seek to extinguish Sacred Pyres, believing this will bring their dark deity's favour.

**Resource Depletion**: Some Pyres require specific rare materials to maintain their strength, and these resources are becoming increasingly scarce.

**Corruption Attempts**: Powerful Umbral magic can sometimes corrupt a Sacred Pyre, turning it into a dark beacon that attracts rather than repels shadow creatures.

**Political Conflicts**: Wars between settlements sometimes threaten Pyres when desperate leaders consider capturing rival communities' light sources.

**The Dying**: Some ancient Pyres have begun to weaken over the years, their flames dimming despite all efforts to maintain them. No one knows why this happens or how to prevent it.

#### The Great Pyre Networks
Before the Eclipse, the Sacred Pyres were connected in vast networks across the continent, allowing for communication, trade coordination, and mutual support. Most of these connections have been severed, but three major networks remain partially intact:

**The Northern Lights**: Seven Pyres in the mountain regions that still communicate regularly, forming a loose confederation of fortress towns.

**The Coastal Beacons**: Maritime Pyres that guide ships and coordinate fishing fleets, keeping coastal communities connected.

**The Scholars' Circle**: Five Pyres maintained by the Scholars of Dawn, used primarily for research and information sharing about the Eclipse.

#### Prophecies and Legends
Ancient texts and surviving prophecies speak of the Sacred Pyres playing a crucial role in ending the Eclipse:

*"When the scattered flames unite as one great fire, the shadow shall retreat and dawn shall return."*

Many believe this refers to somehow reconnecting all the Sacred Pyres into their original network, though others interpret it as needing to find a way to combine the different types of Pyres into a single, supremely powerful flame.

#### Roleplaying Opportunities
The Sacred Pyres offer numerous adventure hooks and character connections:

- **Pyre Pilgrim**: A character dedicated to visiting all known Sacred Pyres
- **Flame Warden**: A guardian of one of these sacred lights
- **Pyre Scholar**: Someone studying the flames to understand their true nature
- **Lost Flame Seeker**: Searching for rumoured Pyres that have been lost or hidden
- **Corruption Cleanser**: Specialising in purifying corrupted Pyres
- **Network Builder**: Working to restore communication between distant Pyres

## üé≠ Themes of the Age of Umbra
- **Survival vs. Humanity**: How much of yourself do you sacrifice to survive?
- **Light vs. Darkness**: Both literal and metaphorical struggles
- **Knowledge vs. Ignorance**: Understanding the Eclipse is key to ending it
- **Unity vs. Isolation**: Communities must work together or fall alone
- **Hope vs. Despair**: Maintaining faith in a seemingly hopeless situation
- **Change vs. Stagnation**: Adapting to new realities while preserving what matters
