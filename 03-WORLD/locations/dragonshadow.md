## üîç Lore & History
### Historical Background
Dragonshadow was founded approximately 80 years ago when a group of Sacred Pyre pilgrims discovered the ancient ruins and felt the strong elemental resonance of the location. The ruins themselves are far older - possibly pre-Umbral, with draconic influences that suggest this was once a place of great importance to the ancient dragons who shaped the Age of Umbra's magical landscape.

### Current Events
The community recently began experiencing stronger magical phenomena around the ruins, with some members reporting prophetic dreams and enhanced elemental abilities. There's growing debate about whether to investigate these changes more deeply or maintain their careful approach to the ancient powers.

### Mysteries & Legends
Local lore speaks of a great dragon who once made this region their domain, leaving behind not just ruins but a lingering magical presence that continues to influence the area. Some believe the dragon may have transcended physical form and become one with the elemental forces that the Sacred Pyre seeks to understand.
