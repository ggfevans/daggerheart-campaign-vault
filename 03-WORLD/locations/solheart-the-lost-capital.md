### Quick Description
The ruined metropolis that once served as the capital of the pre-Eclipse world, now a dangerous wasteland filled with crystal storms, temporal rifts, and guardian constructs.

## üèõÔ∏è Physical Description
### Architecture & Layout
Solheart was once a magnificent capital city with soaring spires, grand avenues, and architectural marvels that showcased the height of pre-Eclipse civilization. Now it lies in ruins, with broken buildings, twisted metal, and crystal formations growing through the wreckage. The original street layout is still partially visible, but navigation is treacherous.

- **The Academic Quarter**: Ruins of universities and research centers, potentially containing invaluable knowledge

### Atmosphere & Mood
The ruins have an overwhelming sense of loss and grandeur fallen. There's an eerie quality to the silence, broken only by the sound of wind through broken structures and the occasional discharge of unstable magical energy. The atmosphere is both melancholic and dangerous.

## üë• Inhabitants & Culture

## üîç Lore & History
### Historical Background
Solheart was the greatest city of the pre-Eclipse world, serving as the political, cultural, and magical center of civilization. When the Eclipse occurred, the city was one of the first to fall, its population fleeing or perishing as the magical catastrophe destroyed the infrastructure that supported millions of people.

### Current Events
The ruins remain largely unexplored due to the extreme dangers, but occasional expeditions are mounted by various factions seeking to recover pre-Eclipse knowledge and artifacts.

### Mysteries & Legends
Legends suggest that the heart of the city contains a chamber where the Eclipse's effects first manifested, that the guardian constructs are protecting something of unimaginable importance, and that somewhere in the ruins lies the key to reversing the Eclipse entirely.
