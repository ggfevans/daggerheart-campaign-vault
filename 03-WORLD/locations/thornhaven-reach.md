# Thornhaven Reach

## üèõÔ∏è Overview
**Type**: Tree-Dwelling Simian Community  
**Location**: Deep Underground Forest, North of Shalk Chasm  
**Population**: ~200-300 Wildborne Simians  
**Status**: Hidden Enclave (Successfully avoided corruption for generations, now at risk of exposure)  
**Primary Function**: Survival community with specialized scout caste  
**Governance**: The Reachguard Elders (Council of experienced community leaders)  

Thornhaven Reach is a sophisticated but naturalistic community of Wildborne Simians who have built their civilization in the canopy of an ancient underground forest located deep beneath the surface north of the Shalk Chasm. The community represents a successful example of long-term survival in the Age of Umbra through isolation, careful resource management, and strict adherence to traditional ways that have kept corruption at bay. However, the recent seismic events that opened the Shalk Chasm have created new fissures and passages that threaten to expose their hidden sanctuary to the dangerous surface world.

## üó∫Ô∏è Geography & Layout

### The Underground Forest
**The Great Cavern**: A massive natural cavern system that houses an ancient forest ecosystem, located deep underground north of the Shalk Chasm. The forest is kept alive by underground springs and bioluminescent fungi that provide dim but sufficient light for the forest to thrive. The cavern ceiling reaches hundreds of feet high, allowing for full-sized trees with expansive canopies.

**Geological Stability**: Historically, the cavern system has been remarkably stable, protected by deep bedrock layers. However, the recent seismic activity that created the Shalk Chasm has begun to affect the deeper underground regions, creating new stress fractures and potential access routes.

**Root Network**: The forest floor is dominated by massive root systems that create natural pathways and defensive barriers. These roots also serve as the foundation for the community's ground-level facilities and emergency shelters. Recent tremors have damaged some root structures and created new openings in previously solid earth.

**Canopy Level**: The primary living space for the community, built within and between the branches of ancient trees. Sophisticated but simple structures made from woven branches, living wood shaping, and natural materials that blend seamlessly with the forest environment.

### Community Structure
**The Crown Circle**: The highest level of the canopy where the Reachguard Elders meet, built within the intertwined branches of the five oldest trees. Features natural amphitheater seating carved from living wood and positioned to overlook the entire community.

**Family Groves**: Residential areas organized by family groups, with each extended family maintaining their own section of interconnected tree dwellings. Connected by sophisticated bridge networks and zip-line systems for rapid movement.

**The Scout Perimeter**: Outer ring of the community dedicated to the specialized scout caste, featuring training areas, equipment storage, and quick-access routes to the cavern's hidden entrances and exits.

**The Thornwall**: The community's primary defense - a carefully cultivated barrier of thorn-bearing plants and defensive trees that creates natural chokepoints and concealment around the settlement's perimeter.

## üë• Community Structure

### The Reachguard Elders
**Role**: Governing council consisting of the community's wisest and most experienced members, drawn from successful scouts, crafters, and community leaders who have proven their commitment to the enclave's survival and principles.

**Authority**: Make all major decisions affecting community security, resource allocation, and adherence to traditional practices. Known for their cautious, deliberate approach to any change that might compromise the community's successful isolation.

**Philosophy**: Maintain that their survival success comes from strict adherence to established protocols, avoidance of outside contact, and rejection of anything they consider "unnatural" - particularly aether magic, which they believe is inherently corrupting.

**Current Stance**: Following Banjo's exile, they have become even more rigid in their interpretation of community rules and more suspicious of any deviation from established practices.

### The Scout Caste
**Role**: Specialized community members responsible for perimeter security, threat assessment, and maintaining the secrecy that has kept Thornhaven Reach hidden from the outside world for generations.

**Training**: Rigorous physical and mental conditioning focused on stealth, environmental awareness, climbing expertise, and silent communication. Scouts are taught to observe and report rather than act independently.

**Protocols**: Strict operational procedures that prioritize community security over individual initiative. Scouts are expected to report all threats to the Reachguard Elders for official judgment and action approval.

**Current Status**: Since Banjo's exile, the scout caste has been restructured with additional oversight and stricter adherence to established protocols.

### General Population
**Crafters**: Skilled artisans who create tools, clothing, and structures using only natural materials and traditional techniques. Known for their ability to work with living wood and organic materials.

**Gatherers**: Community members who manage food production through careful cultivation of the underground forest's resources, maintaining the delicate balance needed for long-term sustainability.

**Keepers**: Elders and specialists who maintain oral traditions, cultural practices, and the community's collective knowledge about survival techniques and forest management.

## üé≠ Culture & Values

### Core Principles
**Traditional Ways**: Belief that their survival success comes from maintaining established practices that have proven effective over generations.

**Natural Harmony**: Living in balance with the underground forest environment, taking only what is needed and giving back to maintain the ecosystem.

**Collective Security**: Individual needs are subordinate to community survival, with personal sacrifice expected when necessary for the greater good.

**Purity Doctrine**: Strict avoidance of anything considered "unnatural" or potentially corrupting, including aether magic, outside technology, and non-traditional practices.

### Social Structure
**Collective Decision Making**: Important community decisions are made through consensus-building processes, though the Reachguard Elders have final authority on matters affecting security and tradition.

**Earned Status**: Community standing is based on demonstrated competence, commitment to traditional values, and contributions to collective survival.

**Generational Wisdom**: Deep respect for elders and traditional knowledge, with younger community members expected to learn and preserve established ways.

### Daily Life
**Dawn Rhythm**: Community is most active during traditional daylight hours, following natural circadian rhythms despite the underground environment.

**Communal Activities**: Regular gatherings for shared meals, storytelling, skill training, and community maintenance work.

**Silent Communication**: Sophisticated system of gesture, touch, and minimal sound communication developed for security purposes but used in daily life.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Security & Survival

### Defense Philosophy
**Concealment First**: Primary defense strategy relies on remaining hidden from external threats rather than direct confrontation.

**Layered Protection**: Multiple defensive systems including the Thornwall, scout patrols, hidden entrances, and emergency evacuation procedures.

**Community Response**: All members trained in basic security procedures and emergency protocols, with specialized roles for different types of threats.

### Threat Assessment
**External Dangers**: Umbra corruption, corrupted creatures, hostile surface dwellers, and environmental hazards from the Age of Umbra.

**Seismic Risks**: The recent geological activity that created the Shalk Chasm has introduced new threats:
- New fissures creating potential access routes for surface threats
- Structural instability threatening the community's tree-based infrastructure
- Possible exposure of the cavern system to surface detection
- Disruption of underground water sources critical to forest survival

**Internal Risks**: Potential corruption within the community, resource depletion, social conflict, and anything that might compromise their successful isolation - now complicated by the physical vulnerability created by seismic damage.

**Security Protocols**: Strict procedures for handling suspected corruption, managing contact with outsiders, and maintaining operational security.

### Survival Strategies
**Resource Management**: Careful cultivation and conservation of the underground forest's resources to ensure long-term sustainability.

**Population Control**: Community size maintained at levels that can be supported indefinitely by available resources.

**Knowledge Preservation**: Oral traditions and practical skills maintained through systematic teaching and practice.

## üéØ Current Status & Developments

### The Corruption Incident
**The Outbreak**: Recent discovery of corruption within the community itself, marking the first major internal threat in generations.

**The Response**: Reachguard Elders demanded adherence to established procedures for handling suspected corruption, prioritizing community protocols over immediate action.

**The Controversy**: Banjo's emergency response actions, including the use of aether abilities, violated community principles and created a crisis of authority and tradition.

### The Exile Decision
**The Charges**: Banjo was accused of "going mad and killing" innocent community members, with his aether abilities cited as evidence of corruption.

**The Politics**: A jealous scout rival exploited the situation to discredit Banjo and advance their own position within the scout caste.

**The Aftermath**: Banjo's exile has reinforced the community's commitment to traditional ways and suspicion of anything deemed "unnatural."
