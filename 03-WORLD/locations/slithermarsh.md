# Slithermarsh

## üó∫Ô∏è Overview
### Location Type
- **Category**: Wilderness/Marshland
- **Region**: Age of Umbra frontier
- **Size**: Vast
- **Population**: Sparse - isolated settlements like [[mires-end]]

### Quick Description
A vast, treacherous marshland region dotted with dangerous waterways, home to isolated settlements and increasing supernatural threats.

## üèõÔ∏è Physical Description
### Architecture & Layout
**Natural Landscape**: Expansive wetland characterized by winding waterways, marsh grasses, and unstable ground. The terrain requires boat travel for longer distances and careful navigation through established paths. Sporadic higher ground provides sites for settlements and ruins.

### Notable Features
- **Waterway Networks**: Complex system of channels, streams, and lakes requiring boat navigation
- **[[destroyed-bridge-crossing]]**: Major crossing point with 100-foot span over raging black water
- **[[the-ruins]]**: Ancient temple complex a few hours travel from [[mires-end]]
- **Established Paths**: Trail systems connecting settlements, though conditions deteriorating

### Atmosphere & Mood
**Growing Menace**: The marshland feels increasingly hostile with supernatural activity on the rise. Black waters hide unknown threats including large serpents. The environment itself seems to resist safe passage, with natural hazards amplified by unnatural influences. An oppressive sense of being watched pervades the region.

## üë• Inhabitants & Culture

- **Laws**: Minimal formal authority - survival-based community cooperation
- **Economy**: Fishing, trading between settlements, resource gathering from marsh

## üé≠ Roleplay Opportunities
