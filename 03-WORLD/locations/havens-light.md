# Haven's Light

## üó∫Ô∏è Overview
### Location Type
- **Category**: City
- **Region**: Central Lands
- **Size**: Large
- **Population**: ~15,000

### Quick Description
Capital fortress city of the Lightkeeper Order, built around the largest remaining solar crystal beacon.

## üèõÔ∏è Physical Description
### Architecture & Layout
Haven's Light is built as a massive fortress city, with concentric rings of defensive walls spiraling inward toward the central Eternal Beacon. The architecture combines military functionality with devotional aesthetics - clean lines, soaring spires, and crystalline elements that catch and reflect any available light. The city is designed to channel and amplify the light from the Eternal Beacon, with mirrors and crystal conduits throughout the structure.

### Notable Features
- **The Eternal Beacon**: The largest remaining solar crystal, providing both physical and magical light that keeps the city safe from Umbral corruption
- **The Dimming Academy**: A school dedicated to teaching light magic and solar techniques to new generations of Lightkeepers
- **New Archive**: A rebuilt library containing salvaged knowledge from before the Eclipse, as well as new research into combating the darkness

### Atmosphere & Mood
The city feels both inspiring and melancholic - a beacon of hope and civilization surrounded by darkness, yet carrying the weight of being one of the last bastions of the old world. The ever-present light creates a sense of warmth and safety, but the visible defensive preparations remind visitors of the constant threat beyond the walls.
