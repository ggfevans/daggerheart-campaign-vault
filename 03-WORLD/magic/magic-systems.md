# Magic in the Age of Umbra

## üåë The Eclipse's Effect on Magic
The Great Eclipse fundamentally changed how magic works in the world. The supernatural darkness doesn't just block light‚Äîit disrupts the flow of magical energy itself, creating unpredictable effects and new forms of power.

### General Magical Changes
- **Unstable Casting**: Spells sometimes fail, backfire, or have unexpected effects
- **Power Fluctuations**: Magic is stronger in some areas, weaker in others
- **New Energy Sources**: The Eclipse itself has become a source of magical power
- **Corrupted Traditions**: Old magical practices now carry risks of corruption
- **Enhanced Alternatives**: Some forms of magic have become more powerful

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Magic (Diminished)
*The fading light of the old world*

### What Solar Magic Was
Before the Eclipse, solar magic was the dominant magical tradition:
- Drawing power directly from sunlight
- Creating permanent light sources and crystal constructs
- Healing magic that channeled life-giving solar energy
- Agricultural magic that enhanced crop growth
- Communication magic using focused light beams

### Current State
**Power Level**: 60-70% of pre-Eclipse strength
**Reliability**: Inconsistent; works better during the brief dawn hours
**Side Effects**: Solar casters often experience fatigue and depression
**Practitioners**: Mostly older mages trained before the Eclipse

### Modern Applications
- **Light Preservation**: Creating temporary sources of illumination
- **Crystal Charging**: Storing what little solar energy remains
- **Healing Arts**: Weakened but still effective medical magic
- **Communication**: Short-range light signals between settlements
- **Defensive Magic**: Barriers and wards against darkness

### Training and Masters
- **Master Helios Dawnstrider**: Last of the Solar Archmagesi, now teaches at Haven's Light
- **The Dimming Academy**: School where traditional techniques are preserved
- **Crystal Workshops**: Where artificers learn to work with diminished power

### Limitations
- **Time Constraints**: Most effective during the pale dawn hours
- **Resource Intensive**: Requires rare materials to amplify weak sunlight
- **Emotional Toll**: Practitioners often struggle with the loss of their former power
- **Corruption Risk**: Attempting to force solar magic can lead to Umbral taint

## üåë Umbral Magic (Dangerous)
*Power drawn from the darkness itself*

### Nature of Umbral Magic
A new form of magic that has emerged since the Eclipse, drawing power from the supernatural darkness:
- **Raw Power**: Often more potent than traditional magic
- **Corruption Risk**: Extended use changes the practitioner physically and mentally
