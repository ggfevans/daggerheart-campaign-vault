# Pre-Eclipse Era: The Luminous Age

## üåü The Golden Era (Before the Great Eclipse)

### The Luminous Empire (Ages Past)
The dominant civilization that ruled much of the known world, powered by mastery of solar magic and crystal technology.

**Capital**: **Solheart** - A magnificent city of crystal spires and ever-burning solar forges
**Territory**: Stretched across three kingdoms and controlled major trade routes
**Population**: Estimated 2-3 million at its height
**Government**: Ruled by the **Council of Solar Mages**, with the **High Luminarch** as ceremonial head

#### Achievements of the Empire
- **Solar Forges**: Massive magical installations that could craft items from pure light
- **Crystal Networks**: Communication and transportation systems using linked crystals
- **Sky Roads**: Bridges of hardened light connecting distant cities
- **The Great Library**: Repository of all magical knowledge, housed in Solheart
- **Agricultural Mastery**: Sun-powered farming that could feed millions

#### The Five Great Cities
1. **Solheart** - Capital and center of solar magic
2. **Prismhaven** - Military stronghold and crystal mines
3. **Dawnport** - Major trading hub and naval base
4. **Brightlands** - Agricultural center and granary
5. **Stellawatch** - Observatory and center of astronomical studies

### The Merchant Republics
Independent city-states that thrived on trade between the Empire and distant lands.

**The River Coalition**: Five cities along the great river systems
- **Goldflow**: Banking and currency exchange
