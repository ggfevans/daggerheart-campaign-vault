# 10-Session Campaign Planning Framework

## üéØ Campaign Arc Structure

### Three-Act Structure (Modified for 10 Sessions)

#### **Act I: Introduction & Setup** (Sessions 1-3)
- **Session 1** (Jul 25): Character introductions, world establishment, first adventure hook
- **Session 2** (Aug 01): First major challenge, community threats revealed
- **Session 3** (Aug 08): Deeper mysteries, expanding world beyond Last Light

#### **Act II: Development & Complications** (Sessions 4-7)
- **Session 4** (Aug 15): Major revelation or plot twist
- **Session 5** (Aug 22): Character development focus, relationship building
- **Session 6** (Aug 29): Rising action, significant challenge or loss
- **Session 7** (Sep 05): Crisis point, characters tested to their limits

#### **Act III: Climax & Resolution** (Sessions 8-10)
- **Session 8** (Sep 12): Major confrontation or decisive action
- **Session 9** (Sep 19): Consequences and final preparations
- **Session 10** (Sep 26): Campaign finale, resolution of main arc

## üìä Pacing Guidelines

### Session Allocation
- **25% Setup** (2.5 sessions): World, characters, initial threats
- **50% Development** (5 sessions): Core adventures, character growth, mounting tension
- **25% Resolution** (2.5 sessions): Climax, consequences, campaign conclusion

### Key Milestones
- **Session 3**: Players should understand the world's stakes and their role
- **Session 5**: Mid-campaign character development checkpoint
- **Session 7**: Major crisis or turning point
- **Session 10**: Satisfying conclusion to the main story arc

## üé™ Session Planning Framework

### Each Session Should Include:
1. **Opening** (10-15 minutes): Previous session recap, current situation
2. **Development** (60-90 minutes): Main adventure content
3. **Character Moments** (15-30 minutes): Roleplay, character development
4. **Cliffhanger/Transition** (5-10 minutes): Setup for next session

### Session Types to Rotate:
- **Adventure Sessions**: Exploration, combat, external challenges
