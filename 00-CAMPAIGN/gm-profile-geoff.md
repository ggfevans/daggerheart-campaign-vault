### Reed (31 sessions)
*"Always asks for feedback to improve his game. Made my character pretty poorly at the start cause I was (and still am) pretty new to ttrpgs. He allowed me to change it even after getting to level 7. Funny and good voice work."*

### Aaron | Gemini Gaming (30 sessions)
*"Geoff is hands down one of the best Dungeon Masters I've had the pleasure of gaming with. His voices, acting, and VTT work is wonderful. I swear, sometimes I forget I'm not talking to a goblin or town mayor. Plus, his commitment to running combat encounters with real stakes? It's like being in the middle of an action-packed fantasy movie."*
