# Daggerheart Campaign Overview

## üåç World & Setting
**Campaign World**: Age of Umbra
**Setting**: A shadow-choked land of decaying fortresses and dreadful monstrosities
**System**: [[daggerheart-srd-index|Daggerheart]]

### Campaign Premise
A century has passed since the God-King Othedias betrayed the Pantheon, provoking divine punishment and abandonment by the gods that left the realm of the Halcyon Domain shattered, desolate, and eternally cursed. Throughout this shadow-choked land of decaying fortresses and dreadful monstrosities, surviving communities cling to hope in the face of lightless oblivion.

As heroic survivors, the party will:
- Protect their community from the terrors beyond their walls

- Perhaps even discover a way to change its fate
