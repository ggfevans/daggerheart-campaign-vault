## ⚰️ **The Sacred Pyre Burns Low...**

In this forsaken realm where the gods have turned their faces away, where corruption seeps through the very stones and the dead refuse their eternal rest, we few survivors cling to fragments of hope and shards of knowledge. These archives serve as both beacon and warning—a testament to those who would dare walk the umbral paths.
