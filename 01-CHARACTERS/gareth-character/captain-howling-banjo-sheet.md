## üé≠ Character Concept: The Forest Predator

### Transformation Story
Once a mischievous underground prankster, the Umbra's corruption forced a dark evolution. When the shadows breached the tunnels and destroyed your community, you fled to the wild forests. There, beyond the protection of Sacred Pyres, you learned that survival meant becoming something others fear.

Your climbing skills that once served elaborate pranks now deliver silent death. The forest taught you that predators move without sound, strike without warning, and vanish without trace. You've returned to civilization as something changed - a necessary monster who hunts other monsters.

### Current Role
**The Eliminator**: While your party controls the battlefield, you remove the biggest threats. Using impossible vertical positioning and forest-learned stealth, you deliver devastating strikes that end fights before they begin.

## üåô Character Concept

### The Shadow Prankster
Captain Howling Banjo is a natural prodigy at moving unseen through the dark tunnels of the Undergarden. What started as elaborate pranks using their exceptional stealth abilities has evolved into valuable security and scouting work for their underground community. Their simian agility and instinctive understanding of shadows makes them nearly invisible when they want to be.

### Experiences
**Acrobat** - Enhanced agility and movement abilities, perfect for navigating the vertical tunnel systems and performing spectacular pranks that involve impossible positioning and timing.

**Observant** - Heightened awareness and perception, essential for night shift work in the dangerous depths and for setting up the perfect prank opportunities.

- **Build**: Compact 4-foot frame with dramatically disproportionate limbs - short torso but with extraordinarily long, graceful arms that seem to flow like liquid shadow when in motion
- **Arms**: Spectacularly long with 7-foot reach - can manipulate objects around corners, through tunnel gratings, and from hiding spots that seem physically impossible, arms nearly twice his body height
- **Legs**: Moderately elongated but not as extreme as arms, allowing for incredible flexibility and the ability to brace against tunnel walls in narrow passages using all four limbs plus tail
- **Posture**: Naturally fluid and relaxed despite unusual proportions, can drape comfortably across beams, hang casually from pipes, or contort into spaces that appear far too small
- **Coloring**: Obsidian - dark fur that blends naturally with the shadows
- **Movement**: Flows rather than walks, with arms that seem to bend and reach in ways that defy normal anatomy, often knuckle-walking or swinging when arms touch ground
- **Clothing**: Dark monastic-style robes in deep charcoal and shadow-black, tattered and weathered from the harsh Age of Umbra, flowing fabric that moves silently despite frayed edges and wear - accommodates his dramatically long arms perfectly. Hidden pockets and climbing tools sewn discretely throughout the worn fabric, with river-barge work clothes worn beneath as a cherished memento from before the darkness fell
- **Attitude**: Like a prankster - mischievous energy barely contained, always seems to be planning something, often gesturing with those impossibly long arms that can reach impossibly far
- **Shadow Markings**: Darker patches in fur that seem to shift slightly in dim light, emphasising the dramatic length of his arms
- **Moon Trinkets**: Collection of small moon-phase charms and reflective objects that catch tunnel light, often dangling from his extraordinary extended reach

## üéí Equipment

- **Stealth Tools**: Lockpicks, grappling hook, climbing gear

- **Moon-phase Pocket Watch**: Keeps track of surface time and moon cycles from underground

## üé≠ Character Details

### Backstory
Born in the bustling tunnels of the Undergarden, Captain Howling Banjo discovered their extraordinary stealth abilities during childhood pranks. What began as harmless tricks - appearing from air vents to startle tunnel merchants, rearranging goods in impossible ways while shopkeepers weren't looking - revealed a natural prodigy's talent for moving unseen through shadows.

The "Captain" title came from their time working the surface rivers with a kind riverboat captain who treated them as crew rather than cargo. When they returned to the Undergarden, the name stuck, and their shipboard experiences gave them a unique perspective on navigation that translated perfectly to the tunnel systems.

As they grew older, their pranking skills proved invaluable for the Undergarden's security. Working the night shift, they became the community's unofficial scout and early warning system, using their shadow-stepping abilities to patrol dangerous areas and gather intelligence. Their playful nature helps lighten the mood during tense situations, but their stealth capabilities are deadly serious when the community needs protection.

### Personality Traits
- **Night Owl**: Most active during darkness, both from habit and preference
- **Playful Prankster**: Uses humor and tricks to build relationships and defuse tension
- **Shadow Dancer**: Moves with fluid grace, seems to flow rather than walk
- **Loyal Scout**: Takes community security seriously despite playful demeanor
- **Moon Howler**: Still howls at the moon when glimpsed through tunnel openings - a quirky habit that brings joy

### Goals & Motivations
- **Primary Goal**: Protect the Undergarden community while having fun doing it
- **Personal Quest**: Perfect the ultimate prank that helps rather than hinders
- **Community Service**: Use stealth skills to keep tunnel dwellers safe
- **Adventure Spirit**: Explore new places while staying true to underground roots

- **River Captain**: Former employer who taught them navigation and leadership
- **Night Shift Crew**: Fellow security workers who appreciate their unique abilities
- **Andi's Character**: [Relationship to be developed through play]

## üìù Background Questions & Answers

### Core Experience Questions

**What did you do that made the people in your community wary of you?**
My pranks started getting too elaborate and realistic. I once made an entire tunnel section "disappear" by redirecting people through hidden passages while rearranging everything behind them - it took three days to convince everyone they weren't losing their minds. The tunnel elders worried I was developing skills that could be used for less innocent purposes, and some merchants started suspecting me every time their inventory seemed off, even when I wasn't involved.

**What mentor taught you to control your untamed abilities, and why are they no longer able to guide you?**
Old Whisper-Steps, the previous night shift leader, taught me that stealth wasn't just about hiding - it was about protecting people by seeing threats they couldn't. She showed me how to channel my natural shadow-dancing into serious security work, turning pranks into patrol routes. But she recently took a position coordinating Undergarden trade with surface settlements, and now I'm the one the younger scouts look up to. Her lessons echo in my head, but I have to find my own way now.

**I have a deep fear I hide from everyone. What is it, and why does it scares me?**
I'm terrified that my stealth abilities make me fundamentally alone. When you can appear and disappear at will, when you move so quietly that people forget you're there, sometimes you wonder if you're really connected to anyone at all. What if I'm so good at hiding that one day I won't be able to find my way back to being seen? The worst part is that the better I get at my job, the more isolated I feel - everyone relies on the shadow who protects them, but no one really knows the person inside the shadows.

### Undergarden-Specific Questions

**What tunnel route do you know that others have forgotten, and what danger does it bypass?**
There's an old maintenance shaft that runs beneath the merchant quarter - most people think it collapsed decades ago, but I discovered it's just cleverly concealed. It bypasses the main tunnel where the Rust Crawler nest has been growing. While everyone else has to take the long way around their territory, I can slip through my secret route and emerge right in the heart of the market district. I haven't told anyone because I use it for my best pranks, but also because if something goes wrong down there, no one would know where to find me.

**Which Undergarden faction leader secretly relies on your skills, and what do you do for them?**
Merchant Guild leader Madame Coppercount officially disapproves of my "disruptive activities," but she privately employs me to test her security measures and gather intelligence on potential threats to trade routes. She pays me in rare surface trinkets and information, and in exchange, I make sure her competitors don't get advance warning about new inventory shipments. She'd never admit to hiring a "prankster rogue," but she knows my shadow-stepping abilities are invaluable for keeping commerce flowing safely.

**What sound from the surface world do you miss most, and why can't you hear it in the tunnels?**
The sound of river water lapping against a boat hull - it's completely different from the dripping and flowing water in the tunnels. River water sounds alive and free, while tunnel water always sounds trapped. When I worked the surface rivers with the old captain, I'd fall asleep to that gentle rhythm every night. Now, even when I howl at the moon through tunnel openings, I'm really trying to call back that sense of movement and freedom that the river sounds represented.
