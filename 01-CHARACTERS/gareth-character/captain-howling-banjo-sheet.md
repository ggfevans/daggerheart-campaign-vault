## Character Description

### **Physical Appearance**

**Build & Proportions**: Compact 4-foot frame with dramatically disproportionate limbs - short torso but extraordinarily long, graceful arms that seem to flow like liquid shadow when in motion. Arms nearly twice his body height with spectacular 7-foot reach, allowing manipulation of objects around corners and from hiding spots that seem physically impossible. Moderately elongated legs provide incredible flexibility for bracing against walls using all four limbs plus prehensile tail.

**Age & Condition**: Someone who should be in his prime but appears weathered far beyond his years. The harsh realities of survival in the Age of Umbra - chronic hunger, unrelenting stress, and constant proximity to death - have carved their mark into his features through purely mundane hardship.

**Facial Features**: 
- **Bone Structure**: Lean, angular jawline where the bone structure shows clearly through thinning facial fur. High, sharp cheekbones made more prominent by the gauntness of survival living.
- **Eyes**: Bright seafoam that glows slightly in darkness, but set deep in his skull as if retreating inward from the weight of what he has witnessed. Despite their mischievous sparkle, these eyes hold depths that speak of moral burdens and impossible choices made in desperate times.
- **Facial Hair**: White to silver gradient beard like an old wise ape, giving him gravitas despite his actual age. The beard partially conceals the sharp angles of his undernourished face.
- **Fur Patterns**: Patches of facial fur have thinned in stress areas - around the temples, along the jawline, creating a hollow appearance that makes his bone structure more pronounced.

**Body Markings**: Obsidian-dark fur that blends naturally with shadows, marked by darker shadow patches that seem to shift slightly in dim light, emphasizing the dramatic length of his arms. Healed battle scars streak across his fur like silver lightning - remnants of desperate fights that left him stronger but forever marked by survival.

**Clothing**: Dark monastic-style robes in deep charcoal and shadow-black. Tattered and weathered from the harsh Age of Umbra - frayed edges, worn patches, and damage from practical use rather than decoration. The flowing fabric moves silently despite its wear, perfectly accommodating his dramatically long arms. Hidden pockets and climbing tools sewn discretely throughout, with salvaged scraps of gambeson armour worn underneath.

**Accessories**: Collection of small moon-phase charms and reflective objects that catch what little light exists, often dangling from his extraordinary extended reach - the only bright spots in his otherwise shadow-focused appearance.

### **Expression Dynamics**

**Default State**: Despite the grimdark world around him, Banjo radiates bright, mischievous energy that seems barely contained. His seafoam eyes sparkle with planned pranks and barely suppressed laughter, creating an almost surreal contrast against the harsh reality of survival. There is often a slight tilt to his head that suggests he is calculating angles for his next bit of harmless chaos, even in the darkest circumstances.

**The Switch**: In an instant - as quick as his shadow-stepping abilities - his expression can snap from playful to distant and hollow. The mischief does not fade gradually; it simply vanishes, as if he has disappeared from the conversation while still physically present. His eyes become vacant, staring through rather than at whoever he is with, and the weight of his moral burdens settles across his features like a shadow. This mirrors his ability to vanish physically - he can disappear emotionally just as completely.

**Predatory Mode**: When threatened or hunting, his fluid, graceful body language shifts to predatory stillness with unsettling speed. The playful glint in those deep-set seafoam eyes becomes something dangerous and calculating. His long arms position themselves with deliberate precision, and his entire posture communicates that the game is over - this is survival, and he is very, very good at it.

### **Movement & Presence**
- **Silent Flow**: Moves like liquid shadow without sound, flowing rather than walking
- **Predatory Grace**: Every motion calculated for maximum efficiency, yet retaining an odd playfulness even in serious moments
- **Vertical Mastery**: Equally comfortable on walls, ceilings, or ground - often positions himself for easy escape or advantage
- **Unsettling Reach**: Arms that bend and reach in ways that defy normal anatomy, sometimes used for dramatic gestures that emphasize a point or set up a prank
- **Playful Positioning**: Even in combat preparation, tends to choose locations that offer both tactical advantage and potential for surprise or mischief

### **Personality Through Physicality**

**Mannerisms**: Often gestures with those impossibly long arms during conversation, sometimes manipulating distant objects as casual displays of ability or subtle pranks. Has a habit of positioning himself where he can easily disappear if needed - near shadows, behind cover, or in elevated positions - but does so in ways that seem almost playful rather than paranoid.

**Stress Responses**: The instant emotional disappearing act - his equivalent of vanishing into shadows but done conversationally. When moral weight hits him, he does not gradually withdraw; he is simply gone, even while still present. The contrast between his bright default state and these hollow moments makes the transition even more jarring.

**Combat Readiness**: Despite his playful nature, there is always an undercurrent of lethal readiness. His relaxed posture can shift to deadly precision in a heartbeat, and those long arms that seem so graceful in normal circumstances become weapons of surprising reach and speed. Even his pranks often serve to test reflexes, awareness, or security - play with a deadly serious purpose.

## Background & History

### **The Exile**
You were caught ruthlessly eliminating corrupted community members using shadow magic that awakened during a life-threatening attack. The Underground Council only saw the aftermath - zombie carnage and reports of you "shadowwalking and killing" - which they interpreted as evidence you were an agent of evil. Interrupted mid-purge, one corrupted survivor escaped your incomplete elimination.

### **The Hunt**
Two groups pursue you relentlessly: the Underground Council seeking justice for what they call "murder," and the corrupted survivor who escaped - now a partially turned thing that hunts you for revenge.

### **The Loss**
Your greatest regret is killing your mentor, Old Whisper-Steps, who taught you everything about stealth and protection. They were among the corrupted during the outbreak, and you had to put a dagger through the heart of the one person who believed in you.

### **The Dreams**
Since childhood, you've dreamed of a waterfall flowing upward, defying natural order. You believe it represents how corruption reverses life into death, and how nothing in the world follows rules anymore - not nature, not morality, not the people you once trusted.

### **Current Fears**
Your Wildborne community relies on the Last Wolf Pack's spirit for protection - wolves who've patrolled against corruption for a century. You are terrified because the newest pups have strange, too-bright eyes that remind you of early corruption signs. The pack grows smaller each year, and you fear you are losing your last guardians.

### **Apocalyptic Vision**
You've witnessed Umbra creatures hunting in organized packs with disturbing intelligence, and encountered corrupted nature spirits from fallen forests actively hunting the remaining pure spirits. The corruption is not random anymore - it is strategic, and it is coming for everything you have left to protect.

## Umbra Corruption Integration

### **Living Weapon Mechanics**
- **Corruption Scars**: Each scar adds +1 damage but brings you closer to full corruption
- **High-Risk Power**: Deliberately take calculated risks for extra damage
- **Time Pressure**: Racing against corruption to accomplish meaningful goals
- **Moral Complexity**: Balance between necessary power and remaining humanity

### **Character Stakes**
Your corruption level affects not just you, but creates urgency for your entire party. Each scar represents both growing power and diminishing time to make a difference in the world.

## Party Role & Relationships

### **Combat Specialization**
- **Priority Target Elimination**: Remove spellcasters, archers, leaders others cannot reach
- **Vertical Battlefield Control**: Access impossible positions for tactical advantage
- **Silent Infiltration**: Scout and eliminate threats without alerting enemies
- **Burst Damage**: End encounters quickly through devastating assassination strikes

### **Unique Value**
You do what others cannot - both in terms of accessing unreachable positions and making morally complex choices. Your willingness to embrace necessary darkness for the greater good makes you the party's moral anchor and most effective eliminator. Your playful nature helps maintain group morale even in the darkest circumstances.

### **Social Dynamics**
Others may question your methods, but they cannot argue with results. You carry the moral weight so your companions can maintain their principles, making you both essential and isolated within the group. Your moments of genuine playfulness remind everyone that humanity can survive even in the Age of Umbra.

##  Signature Abilities Summary

### **The Phantom Strike** (Combat Sequence)
Your signature move combining all abilities: silent shadow approach, impossible vertical positioning, devastating sneak attack with magical returning blade, and supernatural escape - often executed with an almost playful flourish that unnerves enemies.

### **Corruption Hunter** (Investigation)
Using Purge Veteran experience to identify corruption signs, assess threat levels, and make tactical decisions about elimination versus mercy. Your playful demeanor often masks your deadly serious analysis of threats.

### **Shadow Predator** (Stealth/Tracking)
Umbral Stalker abilities allow tracking and hunting corrupted beings through terrain others cannot navigate, using shadow magic and primal instincts while maintaining the capacity for strategic mischief.

### **Moral Anchor** (Social/Mental)
Despite your dark methods, you serve as the party's moral anchor for impossible decisions - you have already paid the price others fear, allowing you to guide them through ethical complexity while somehow maintaining hope and humour in a hopeless world.
