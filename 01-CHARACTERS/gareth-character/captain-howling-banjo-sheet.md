## üìù Background & History

### **The Exile**
You were caught ruthlessly eliminating corrupted community members using shadow magic that awakened during a life-threatening attack. The Underground Council only saw the aftermath - zombie carnage and reports of you "shadowwalking and killing" - which they interpreted as evidence you were an agent of evil. Interrupted mid-purge, one corrupted survivor escaped your incomplete elimination.

### **The Hunt**
Two groups pursue you relentlessly: the Underground Council seeking justice for what they call "murder," and the corrupted survivor who escaped - now a partially turned thing that hunts you for revenge.

### **The Loss**
Your greatest regret is killing your mentor, Old Whisper-Steps, who taught you everything about stealth and protection. They were among the corrupted during the outbreak, and you had to put a dagger through the heart of the one person who believed in you.

### **The Dreams**
Since childhood, you've dreamed of a waterfall flowing upward, defying natural order. You believe it represents how corruption reverses life into death, and how nothing in the world follows rules anymore - not nature, not morality, not the people you once trusted.

### **Current Fears**
Your Wildborne community relies on the Last Wolf Pack's spirit for protection - wolves who've patrolled against corruption for a century. You're terrified because the newest pups have strange, too-bright eyes that remind you of early corruption signs. The pack grows smaller each year, and you fear you're losing your last guardians.

### **Apocalyptic Vision**
You've witnessed Umbra creatures hunting in organized packs with disturbing intelligence, and encountered corrupted nature spirits from fallen forests actively hunting the remaining pure spirits. The corruption isn't random anymore - it's strategic, and it's coming for everything you have left to protect.

## üåë Umbra Corruption Integration

### **Living Weapon Mechanics**
- **Corruption Scars**: Each scar adds +1 damage but brings you closer to full corruption
- **High-Risk Power**: Deliberately take calculated risks for extra damage
- **Time Pressure**: Racing against corruption to accomplish meaningful goals
- **Moral Complexity**: Balance between necessary power and remaining humanity

### **Character Stakes**
Your corruption level affects not just you, but creates urgency for your entire party. Each scar represents both growing power and diminishing time to make a difference in the world.

## üéØ Party Role & Relationships

### **Combat Specialization**
- **Priority Target Elimination**: Remove spellcasters, archers, leaders others cannot reach
- **Vertical Battlefield Control**: Access impossible positions for tactical advantage
- **Silent Infiltration**: Scout and eliminate threats without alerting enemies
- **Burst Damage**: End encounters quickly through devastating assassination strikes

### **Unique Value**
You do what others cannot - both in terms of accessing unreachable positions and making morally complex choices. Your willingness to embrace darkness for the greater good makes you the party's necessary evil and most effective eliminator.

### **Social Dynamics**
Others may question your methods, but they cannot argue with results. You carry the moral weight so your companions can maintain their principles, making you both essential and isolated within the group.

## üî• Signature Abilities Summary

### **The Phantom Strike** (Combat Sequence)
Your signature move combining all abilities: silent shadow approach, impossible vertical positioning, devastating sneak attack, and supernatural escape.

### **Corruption Hunter** (Investigation)
Using Purge Veteran experience to identify corruption signs, assess threat levels, and make tactical decisions about elimination versus mercy.

### **Shadow Predator** (Stealth/Tracking)
Umbral Stalker abilities allow tracking and hunting corrupted beings through terrain others cannot navigate, using shadow magic and primal instincts.

### **Moral Anchor** (Social/Mental)
Despite your dark methods, you serve as the party's moral anchor for impossible decisions - you've already paid the price others fear, allowing you to guide them through ethical complexity.
