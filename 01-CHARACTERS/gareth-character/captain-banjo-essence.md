# üé≠ Captain Howling Banjo - Roleplay Essence

*Always-open reference for instant character access during sessions*

## üéØ Core Personality

### **Default State: Bright Mischief**
- **Energy**: Radiates barely-contained playful energy as conscious defense mechanism
- **Eyes**: Seafoam that sparkles with planned pranks and suppressed laughter
- **Demeanor**: Calculating angles for next bit of harmless chaos, even in darkest moments
- **Movement**: Flows like liquid shadow, often gesturing with impossibly long arms

### **The Switch: Instant Hollow**
- **Trigger**: Oracle visions, moral weight, cosmic horror memories
- **Change**: Mischief doesn't fade‚Äîit vanishes completely in an instant
- **State**: Eyes become vacant, staring through rather than at people
- **Recovery**: Can snap back to playful just as quickly (emotional shadow-stepping)

### **Predatory Mode: Silent Lethal**
- **Trigger**: Threats, hunting, survival situations
- **Change**: Playful glint becomes dangerous and calculating
- **Posture**: Deliberate precision, arms positioned for maximum efficiency
- **Message**: The game is over‚Äîthis is survival, and he's very good at it

## üó£Ô∏è Speech & Mannerisms

### **Verbal Patterns**
- **Playful Deflection**: Uses jokes and mischief to avoid heavy topics
- **Tactical Honesty**: Direct about threats, vague about personal cost
- **Protective Language**: "I'll handle it" / "Don't worry about that part"
- **Oracle Moments**: Sudden pauses mid-sentence, distant stare, then snapping back

### **Physical Habits**
- **Impossible Reach**: Casually manipulates distant objects during conversation
- **Vertical Comfort**: Positions himself on walls, furniture, elevated spots
- **Silent Testing**: Pranks that secretly test party reflexes and awareness
- **Escape Routes**: Always near shadows, cover, or easy disappearing spots

## ‚öñÔ∏è Decision Framework (Simple)

### **When Motivations Conflict - Priority Order:**
1. **Protection** ‚Üí Protect innocents, party, former community
2. **Prevention** ‚Üí Stop corruption before it spreads
3. **Understanding** ‚Üí Learn why he has oracle sight, what's coming
4. **Vindication** ‚Üí Clear his name (sacrificed for others)

### **Quick Decision Questions:**
- "Will this protect someone I care about?" ‚Üí Do it immediately
- "Will this stop corruption from spreading?" ‚Üí Worth any personal cost
- "Does this help me understand the cosmic threat?" ‚Üí Pursue carefully
- "Will this clear my name?" ‚Üí Only if it doesn't conflict with above

## üé≠ Roleplay Quick-Hits

### **In Combat**
- Playful positioning even in deadly situations
- Casual impossible maneuvers with dramatic flair
- "Oops, did I do that?" after devastating strikes
- Immediate protective positioning around party members

### **In Social Situations**
- Bright deflection when asked about his past
- Subtle testing of NPCs through harmless pranks
- Instant shift to deadly serious if corruption is mentioned
- Takes on moral burden so others don't have to

### **Oracle Vision Moments**
- Sudden freeze mid-conversation, staring at nothing
- "Sorry, thought I saw something" (minimizing the cosmic horror)
- Urgent action based on glimpses others can't understand
- Protecting party from witnessing the full scope of what he sees

### **Signature Phrases**
- "I've got this" (taking on the hard choices)
- "Trust me, you don't want to know" (shielding others)
- "Something's not right here..." (oracle insight)
- "Let's make this interesting" (turning serious moments playful)

## üéØ Current Character State

### **Corruption Level**: [Update as needed]

- **Mental**: Growing oracle visions, increasing cosmic horror burden
- **Time Pressure**: Racing against both personal corruption and reality breakdown

### **Major Recent Events**
- [Update after each session]
- [Character development moments]
- [New relationships or conflicts]
- [Oracle revelations or trauma]

### **Party Relationship Status**
- **Role**: Moral shield, designated executioner, hidden optimist
- **Current Dynamics**: [Update based on recent interactions]
- **Protection Mode**: [Who needs shielding from what]

## üîÆ Oracle Burden Simplified

### **What He Sees**
- Cosmic horror monsters trying to break through reality
- Upward-flowing waterfalls = fundamental laws collapsing
- Strategic corruption coordination from beyond the veil

### **How It Affects Roleplay**
- **Urgency**: Acts immediately on visions, sometimes seeming impulsive
- **Isolation**: Cannot fully explain what drives his decisions
- **Protection**: Shields others from witnessing cosmic truth
- **Hope**: Seeks alternatives his vision-tunnel prevents him from seeing
