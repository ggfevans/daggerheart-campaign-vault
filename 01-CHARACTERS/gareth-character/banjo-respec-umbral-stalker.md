## üé≠ **Character Evolution Narrative**

### **Backstory Transformation**
**Before the Change**:

- Safe in underground tunnels with community protection
- Playful trickster with natural agility and long reach

**The Corruption Event**:
- Umbra breached the underground settlements
- Community destroyed, forced to flee to the surface
- Survival in the wild forests beyond Sacred Pyre protection
- Learned that pranks became kills when survival demanded it

**Current State**:
- Wildborne survivor who learned brutal efficiency
- Returns to civilization as something changed and dangerous
- Uses same climbing skills for assassination instead of mischief
- Silent forest predator bringing deadly skills to urban environments

### **Personality Shift**
- **Before**: Playful trickster using skills for entertainment
- **After**: Grim protector using same skills for elimination
- **Core**: Still the same person, but circumstances forced dark evolution
- **Conflict**: Struggles with what they've become vs. what they must do

## üî• **Signature Combat Tactics**

### **"The Phantom Strike"**
1. **Silent Approach**: Use Lightfoot advantage + Midnight Domain stealth
2. **Impossible Position**: Simian climbing to reach unreachable vantage (ceiling, beam, tree)
3. **Precise Elimination**: Dagger sneak attack + Umbra corruption damage
4. **Vanish**: Grace Domain mobility to escape to new position
5. **Reposition**: Set up next impossible angle attack

### **Tactical Applications**
- **Enemy Archers**: Climb to their position, eliminate from behind
- **Spellcasters**: Silent approach through vertical spaces others can't access
- **Sentries**: Remove without alerting main force
- **Leaders**: Surgical elimination to break enemy command structure

### **Environmental Advantages**
- **Urban**: Pipes, beams, architectural elements for positioning
- **Wilderness**: Trees, cliffs, natural vertical terrain
- **Underground**: Original tunnel knowledge combined with new skills
- **Any Terrain**: 7-foot reach means "melee" extends farther than normal

## üé™ **Roleplaying Opportunities**

### **Internal Conflict**
- **Moral Struggle**: Wrestling with necessary brutality vs. original nature
- **Identity Crisis**: Am I still Banjo, or something else entirely?
- **Corruption Fear**: How much darkness can I embrace before I'm lost?
- **Purpose Question**: Using evil methods for good - does that make me evil?

### **Party Dynamics**
- **Augustus**: Respects his honor but uses methods he cannot
- **Aster**: Grateful for protection but concerned about your soul
- **Vaerenth**: Professional respect for complementary skills
- **Trust Issues**: Others questioning if you can be trusted

### **Social Interactions**

- **Criminal Respect**: Those who live in shadows recognize a peer
- **Information Gathering**: Your reputation opens certain doors

## üîß **Equipment & Gear Considerations**

### **Armor Philosophy**
- **Light Armor**: Prioritize mobility over protection
- **Stealth Focus**: Quiet materials, dark colors
- **Climbing Gear**: Tools integrated into daily equipment
- **Concealability**: Weapons and tools that don't draw attention
