### Leonardo.ai Prompt
```
Portrait of Captain Howling Banjo, simian humanoid rogue assassin from dark fantasy Age of Umbra setting. 4-foot tall compact frame with dramatically disproportionate anatomy - short torso, extraordinarily long graceful arms nearly twice body height. Obsidian-dark fur blending with shadows, marked by darker shadow patches that shift in dim light. Weathered far beyond years from survival hardship - chronic hunger, stress, cosmic horror exposure. Lean angular jawline with bone structure visible through thinning facial fur, high sharp cheekbones made prominent by gauntness. Bright seafoam eyes that glow slightly in darkness, set deep in skull as if retreating from witnessed horrors, yet sparkling with mischievous energy despite depths of cosmic knowledge. White to silver gradient beard like old wise ape giving gravitas. Patches of facial fur thinned around temples and jawline from stress, creating hollow appearance. Healed battle scars streak across fur like silver lightning from desperate survival fights. Patchwork leather gambeson armor cobbled from multiple sources, stitched with sinew and bone needles, permanently stained with dark blood ranging from rust-brown to crimson. Tattered forest-green scout cloak over armor, shredded by brambles and fights, held together with sinew stitching and bone toggles. Hood deep enough to shadow features. Small moon-phase charms dangling from extended reach - only bright spots in shadow-focused appearance. Despite grimdark world, radiates bright mischievous energy as defense mechanism. Slight head tilt suggesting calculating angles for harmless chaos. Dark fantasy art style, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, rim lighting on fur, Age of Umbra grimdark aesthetic, highly detailed concept art.

## 🔧 Prompt Refinement Guidelines

### Critical Character Elements to Maintain

**Anatomy Specifics:**
- Always emphasize "4-foot height" vs "7-foot arm reach" 
- "Arms nearly twice body height" is crucial for proportion
- "Compact frame with disproportionate limbs"
- Include prehensile tail when showing full body

**Distinctive Features:**
- Seafoam glowing eyes (unique identifier)
- Silver-white gradient beard on angular face
- Battle scars like "silver lightning" on dark fur
- Patches of thinned fur showing bone structure

**Armor Description Accuracy:**

- "Stitched with sinew, bone needles, hide strips"
- "Permanent bloodstains rust-brown to crimson"
- "Forest moss in creases" for natural camouflage
- "Tattered forest-green scout cloak" not bright or new

### If Results Need Adjustment:

- Emphasize: "beast-folk characteristics, simian facial features"

**For Correct Arm Proportions:**
- Add: "arms twice the length of torso, impossibly extended reach"
- Specify: "dramatic limb disproportion, elongated appendages"

**For Grittier Survival Aesthetic:**
- Add: "post-apocalyptic survival gear, weathered by harsh elements"
- Emphasize: "battle-scarred, survival-hardened, grimdark realism"

**For Better Expression Balance:**
- Add: "mischievous personality masking deep trauma"
- Specify: "bright defensive energy hiding cosmic horror burden"

**For Accurate Armor Details:**
- Add: "makeshift patchwork armor, cobbled survival gear"
- Emphasize: "blood-stained leather, battle-damaged equipment"
