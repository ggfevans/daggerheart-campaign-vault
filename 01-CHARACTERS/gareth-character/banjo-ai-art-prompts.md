## üîß Prompt Refinement Tips

### If Results Need Adjustment:

**For More Simian Features:**
- Add: "ape-like facial structure, elongated limbs, primate anatomy"
- Emphasize: "non-human proportions, beast-folk characteristics"

**For Better Arm Proportions:**
- Add: "arms twice the length of torso, impossibly long reach"
- Specify: "disproportionate limb anatomy, elongated appendages"

**For Darker Aesthetic:**
- Add: "grimdark fantasy, Age of Umbra corruption, post-apocalyptic"
- Emphasize: "weathered, battle-scarred, survival-hardened"

**For Better Expression Balance:**
- Add: "mischievous yet haunted, playful but deadly"
- Specify: "bright personality masking cosmic horror burden"

### Character Consistency Notes
- Always mention the 4-foot height vs dramatically long arms
- Seafoam glowing eyes are a key distinctive feature
- The weathered, tattered robes contrast with his playful nature
- Battle scars should look like "silver lightning" on dark fur
- Moon-phase charms are his only bright accessories
