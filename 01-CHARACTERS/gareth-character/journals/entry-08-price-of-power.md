# Entry 8: The Price of Power
*Age 26 - Umbra Scarring*

**The corruption is in me now, and I invited it in.**

Not the mind-twisting, body-warping kind that turns people into the monsters I hunt. Something else. Something that makes me faster, stronger, more deadly - **and pays for it with pieces of my humanity carved away like bark from an ancient tree.**

The first scar came during the Thornwood Massacre. Forty-three corrupted villagers, transformed into a living forest that screamed with their voices every time the wind moved through their branches. **I should have died in that fight.** Would have, if something vast and patient hadn't whispered instructions in the spaces between my shadow-steps.

*Step here. Strike there. Let the darkness flow through you like water through roots.*

When the battle ended, I found a mark carved into my forearm. Not a wound - more like a tattoo made of living shadow that pulses sometimes, especially when I'm fighting. **Makes my blade cut deeper, my movements flow like liquid darkness itself.**

**The visions are clearer now.** I can see the corruption's source - something immense pressing against reality's boundaries, using our world as a testing ground for experiments in breaking down natural laws. The upward-flowing waterfalls aren't just dreams anymore. They're glimpses of what happens when physics themselves become corrupted.

Each scar makes me more effective against it. Also makes me less... **human.** I catch myself making tactical decisions about people's lives with chilling efficiency. Calculating acceptable losses. Prioritizing targets based on corruption threat levels rather than individual worth.

**Three weeks ago, I would have tried to save the infected children in Millbrook. Yesterday, I eliminated them immediately because my scars showed me they were already too far gone.**

I was right. The autopsies I performed afterward proved the corruption had replaced their nervous systems entirely, turning them into living lures for more victims. **But the ease with which I made that choice terrifies me almost as much as the gratitude in their eyes as I freed them.**

**Is this how it starts?** Does everyone who fights monsters eventually become one?

The worst part is that **I'm more effective this way.** More lives saved overall. More corruption sites neutralized. More preparation for whatever cosmic horror is coming.

But I look in the still water of corrupted pools now and sometimes don't recognize what looks back. The scarred thing in the reflection grins with too many teeth, **and its seafoam eyes hold depths that speak of bargains made with darkness itself.**

**Yet somehow, impossibly, I still find reasons to laugh.** Yesterday I left a corrupted tax collector hanging upside down from a tree with a sign: "Interest rates now adjusting for inflation AND corruption!" 

**Maybe humor is the last thing the darkness can't touch. Maybe laughter is what keeps me human even as I become something else entirely.**
