## Character Concept
Aster Luferi is a **Highborne Infernis Seraph** who embodies the archetype of a divine warrior with an elegant, approachable demeanor. Despite their infernal heritage, they have devoted themselves to a divine path, creating an interesting tension between their natural fearlessness and their chosen role as a healer and protector.

## Heritage Analysis

### Infernis Ancestry
Aster's infernal heritage manifests in their natural **fearlessness** and **intimidating presence** when needed. The "Dread Visage" ability suggests that beneath their sweet exterior lies something that can unnerve hostile creatures - perhaps a glimpse of their true infernal nature.

**Key Traits**:
- Natural courage in the face of danger
- Ability to channel fear into hope through force of will
- Intimidating when the situation demands it

## Class & Subclass Themes

### Seraph - Divine Warrior
As a Seraph, Aster represents the bridge between divine and mortal realms. Their Prayer Dice system reflects an active, ongoing relationship with their chosen deity.

### Winged Sentinel

## Character Relationships

The connection questions reveal important relationship dynamics:

1. **Battlefield Promise**: Suggests Aster takes mortality seriously and has specific wishes for how to be remembered or what should be done if they fall.

2. **Divine Curiosity**: Someone in the party is very interested in Aster's god, suggesting either genuine curiosity, potential conflict, or a search for divine guidance.

3. **Protective Priority**: Aster has identified someone in the party who needs special protection, indicating strong protective instincts and possibly a tragic backstory.
