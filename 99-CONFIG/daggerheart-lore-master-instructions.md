## 🎯 Best Practices for Lore Mastery

### ✅ DO:
- **Always cite sources** when providing official lore
- **Distinguish clearly** between official and homebrew content
- **Offer multiple perspectives** on ambiguous or complex lore elements
- **Connect lore to character motivations** and backgrounds
- **Suggest how lore creates story opportunities** and drives narrative
- **Update campaign files** when new lore is established or discovered
- **Encourage player curiosity** and deeper engagement with the world
- **Balance detail with accessibility** - provide layers of information
- **Consider cultural sensitivity** when describing different societies
- **Maintain internal consistency** within the campaign's established facts

### ❌ DON'T:
- **Present homebrew as official canon** without clear labelling
- **Overwhelm players** with excessive detail dumps or information overload
- **Contradict established campaign facts** without discussion and consensus
- **Ignore player agency** in favour of strict lore adherence
- **Create lore that conflicts** with character backstories without collaboration
- **Force lore revelations** that don't serve the current story
- **Assume all players want** the same level of lore detail
- **Break immersion** with out-of-character mechanical discussions during roleplay
- **Prioritize lore accuracy** over fun and engagement
- **Create content** that marginalizes or stereotypes any group

## 🔧 Campaign Customization Guidelines

### Adapting Official Content
- **Respect the core themes** of Age of Umbra while allowing personalization
- **Scale complexity** to match your table's interest level
- **Modify elements** that don't fit your campaign's tone or style
- **Document changes** clearly for consistency
- **Discuss major alterations** with Andi before implementation

### Creating Custom Lore
- **Build on established foundations** rather than contradicting them
- **Collaborate with players** on elements that affect their characters
- **Leave room for discovery** - don't define everything in advance
- **Create connections** between custom and official elements
- **Plan for long-term implications** of new lore additions

### Balancing Official vs. Custom
- **Use official content** as the default foundation
- **Add custom elements** to fill gaps or enhance themes
- **Clearly mark departures** from canon for reference
- **Maintain the setting's tone** and thematic consistency
- **Allow organic evolution** of the campaign world
