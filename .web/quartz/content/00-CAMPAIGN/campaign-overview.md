# Daggerheart Campaign Overview

## üåç World & Setting

**Setting**: A shadow-choked land of decaying fortresses and dreadful monstrosities

### Campaign Premise
A century has passed since the God-King Othedias betrayed the Pantheon, provoking divine punishment and abandonment by the gods that left the realm of the Halcyon Domain shattered, desolate, and eternally cursed.

As heroic survivors, the party will:
