# Umbra Corruption

## üìö Official Sources
- **Daggerheart Core Rule Book**: Age of Umbra campaign frame central threat
- **Critical Role Wiki**: [Age of Umbra](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Age_of_Umbra)
- **Age of Umbra Miniseries**: Primary antagonistic force throughout series

## üéØ Campaign Relevance
The Umbra is the central threatening force in our Age of Umbra campaign. Understanding its nature, effects, and patterns is essential for character survival, community protection, and the overall narrative arc of our adventures in the [[halcyon-domain-geography|Halcyon Domain]].

## üåë Nature of the Umbra

### Physical Description
The Umbra manifests as a **dark, ethereal mass** that roams throughout the [[halcyon-domain-geography|Halcyon Domain]]. This shadowy entity appears to be:
- **Incorporeal**: Not bound by physical barriers in conventional ways
- **Adaptive**: Takes different forms depending on circumstances
- **Persistent**: Continues its corrupting influence over extended periods
- **Intelligent**: Demonstrates purposeful behavior rather than random movement

### Origins and Purpose
- **Post-Apostasy Emergence**: The Umbra appeared after **[[the-apostasy|the Apostasy]]** when the [[veiled-gods|Veiled Gods]] abandoned the realm
- **Divine Vacuum**: May represent the corrupting force that filled the space left by departed divine protection
- **Soul Harvesting**: Claims fallen souls for its own malevolent purposes
- **Territorial Expansion**: Actively works to corrupt and control larger areas

## ‚ò†Ô∏è Corrupting Effects

### Environmental Corruption
The Umbra **corrupts everything it touches**, including:
- **Landscape**: Transforms natural environments into twisted, hostile terrain
- **Vegetation**: Plants become diseased, thorny, or carnivorous
- **Water Sources**: Contamination of wells, streams, and other water supplies
- **Weather Patterns**: Unnatural storms, perpetual gloom, or oppressive atmosphere

### Creature Corruption
- **Death and Reanimation**: Claims the souls of the dead and prevents peaceful rest
- **Monstrous Transformation**: Fallen souls are reborn as **twisted, nightmarish forms**
- **Enhanced Hostility**: Corrupted creatures become **fiendish monstrosities**
- **Unnatural Abilities**: **Umbra-touched beasts crit on 19-20** instead of just natural 20s

### Human Impact
- **Psychological Effects**: Exposure causes fear, despair, and mental deterioration
- **Physical Corruption**: Extended contact may cause bodily transformation
- **Spiritual Damage**: Threatens the integrity of the soul itself
- **Community Breakdown**: Corrupted individuals become threats to their former allies

## üå™Ô∏è The Umbra Wind

### Periodic Phenomenon
The **Umbra Wind** represents the most dangerous manifestation of the corruption:
- **Frequency**: Occurs every **6 to 12 months**
- **Scale**: Affects entire regions simultaneously
- **Intensity**: Puts people in **extreme danger** regardless of normal protections
- **Direction**: Most recently moves from **West at Amber Reach towards the South**

### Effects and Preparation
- **Emergency Protocols**: Communities must take extraordinary protective measures
- **Travel Cessation**: All movement between settlements becomes impossible
- **Resource Strain**: Requires significant preparation and stockpiling
- **Casualty Risk**: Even well-protected communities may suffer losses

## üõ°Ô∏è Resistance and Protection

### Sacred Pyre Immunity
- **[[sacred-pyres|Sacred Pyres]]** provide the only reliable protection against Umbra corruption
- **Safe Zones**: Areas within pyre influence remain uncorrupted
- **Light Barriers**: Divine flames create boundaries the Umbra cannot cross
- **Community Shields**: Settlements cluster around pyres for survival

### Untouched Regions
- **Mysterious Immunity**: Some rare regions remain **mysteriously uncorrupted**
- **Unknown Causes**: No clear explanation for why certain areas resist corruption
- **Strategic Value**: These regions become highly contested and valuable
- **Research Opportunities**: Understanding their immunity could provide broader protection

### Resistance Limitations
- **Temporary Measures**: Most protections require constant maintenance and renewal
- **Resource Dependency**: Protection requires ongoing supply of blessed materials
- **Range Limits**: Safety zones have finite boundaries beyond which corruption spreads
- **Overwhelming Force**: Umbra Wind can challenge even Sacred Pyre protections

## üß¨ Corruption Patterns

### Spread Mechanics
- **Geographic Progression**: Appears to move and expand across the landscape
- **Contamination Points**: Establishes focal points from which corruption radiates
- **Network Effects**: Connected corruption zones may reinforce each other
- **Resistance Erosion**: Gradually wears down natural defenses over time

### Targeted Corruption
- **Soul Vulnerability**: Targets dying or dead individuals for transformation
- **Weakness Exploitation**: Seeks out areas with reduced divine protection
- **Community Infiltration**: May work through corrupted individuals to spread within settlements
- **Knowledge Destruction**: Appears to target repositories of pre-Apostasy wisdom

## üëπ Corrupted Entities

### Undead Transformations
- **Fallen Souls**: Dead individuals become available for Umbra manipulation
- **Twisted Reanimation**: Resurrection in **nightmarish forms** unlike original appearance
- **Enhanced Hostility**: Transformed beings become actively malevolent
- **Retained Knowledge**: May retain some memories or abilities from life

### Living Corruption
- **Umbra-Touched Beasts**: Animals affected by corruption become more dangerous
- **Enhanced Lethality**: **Critical hits on 19-20** instead of standard natural 20s
- **Behavioral Changes**: Become more aggressive and unpredictable
- **Physical Mutations**: May develop unnatural features or abilities

### Intelligent Corrupted
- **Former Humans**: People who succumb to corruption but retain intelligence
- **Infiltration Agents**: Capable of operating within uncorrupted communities
- **Strategic Threats**: Can plan and coordinate attacks rather than acting randomly
- **Moral Complexity**: Raise questions about redemption and identity
