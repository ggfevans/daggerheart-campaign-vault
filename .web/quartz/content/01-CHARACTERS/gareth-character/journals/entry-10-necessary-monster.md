# Entry 10: The Necessary Monster
*Age 28 - Present Day*

**Today I met companions who might actually understand.**

Not the oracle sight - **I'll probably never find another who sees what I see.** But the weight of necessary choices. The burden of doing terrible things for essential reasons. The loneliness of being the person who acts when others hesitate.

**They accepted me despite knowing what I am. Maybe because of it.**

For the first time in years, I sat around a fire with people who didn't flinch when I moved too fast or too silently. Who didn't watch my hands for signs of aggression. Who didn't treat every word as potential threat or lie. **Who laughed at my jokes even when they were inappropriate responses to cosmic horror.**

**I'd forgotten what it felt like to be trusted.** To have someone hand you their back without checking first to make sure you weren't about to plant a knife in it.

The oracle visions are stronger than ever now. I see the final incursion approaching - something so vast it will rewrite the laws of physics just by existing in our dimension. **The corruption I've been fighting is just the advance scouts.** The real invasion hasn't started yet.

But I also see something else in these new companions. **Potential.** The ability to find solutions I can't see because my visions focus on threats, not opportunities. They look at problems I'd solve with a blade and find entirely different approaches.

**Maybe that's why we found each other.** Maybe the oracle sight isn't just about seeing dangers - maybe it's about recognizing the people capable of changing the game entirely.

I won't burden them with the full scope of what's coming. Not yet. **They have their own growth to do, their own strength to find.** But when the time comes - when reality itself starts breaking down and impossible choices have to be made - I'll be ready to stand between them and the darkness.

**I've spent years becoming the monster this world needs.** Accepting corruption to fight corruption. Embracing isolation to protect connection. Sacrificing my humanity to preserve the human.

But around this fire, listening to their voices, seeing their capacity for hope despite everything... **I remember why it's worth it.** Why someone has to be willing to damn themselves so others can remain pure. Why the necessary monster has to exist.

**The waterfalls still flow upward in my dreams.** But now, sometimes, I dream of them flowing down again. Of natural laws restored, reality healed, the barriers between dimensions strong and true.

I don't know if those dreams are prophecy or just hope. **But for the first time since my exile, I'm willing to believe they might be both.**

My companions are sleeping now, trusting me to keep watch. **One of them is even snoring.** The sound is ridiculously comforting - proof that somewhere in this forsaken Age of Umbra, people can still sleep peacefully because someone else is willing to stare into the cosmic darkness and grin back at it.

**My name is Captain Howling Banjo. I am the shadow between the light and the darkness. I am the price paid for tomorrow's possibility.**

**And despite everything - the scars, the exile, the terrible knowledge of what's coming - I am no longer alone.**

**In fact, I think I just figured out my next prank.** Something involving their bedrolls and strategically placed bioluminescent fungi from my homeland. **Even at the end of the world, some traditions are sacred.**
