# Entry 11: The Last Light and Dark Revelations
*Age 28 - Session 1 Events*

**Well, THAT escalated quickly.**

What started as a simple evening at Hope's Call - nursing a drink, critiquing painfully off-key entertainment, and methodically working through their surprisingly decent fried fish - turned into exactly the kind of night that reminds me why I love my new companions and hate cosmic horror in equal measure.

**I'd positioned myself perfectly in the corner booth,** of course. Old habits from my scout training die hard, even when I'm trying to enjoy a peaceful meal. Seafoam eyes scanning the room, long arms casually within reach of weapons, forest-green hood casting just enough shadow to read everyone's body language without them reading mine.

**Then someone screamed outside.**

The sound cut through the tavern's warm atmosphere like a corrupted blade through healthy bark. **Not just any scream - the specific kind of terror that means something has gone very, very wrong.** My companions didn't hesitate. [[vaerenth-character-sheet|Vaerenth]] bolted for the door first, [[aster-luferi-character-sheet|Aster]] close behind, [[augustus-penhallow-character-sheet|Augustus]] following with that methodical Guardian pace.

**I love that they run toward danger instead of away from it.**

What we found outside Last Light's walls was everything my oracle visions had been trying to prepare me for, and somehow still worse than expected. A soldier - Nicholas Vakvom, as we learned - being hunted through misty marshland by skeletal undead. **Armored skeleton warriors, a bone archer, and something spider-like with too many limbs that made my Umbra scars itch just looking at it.**

The combat was... **refreshing.** After years of fighting alone, coordinating with people who understand tactics and don't panic at the sight of danger was almost therapeutic. I took some hits - **2 armor damage, 2 health, managed to heal 1 back** - but watching Aster devastate enemies with those Arcane Gauntlets while Vaerenth picked off targets with her shortbow made me remember why teamwork can be more effective than lone wolf tactics.

**We saved Nicholas. That's what matters.**

But then things got... **complicated.**

Some rival adventuring group decided to make a play for community leadership by publicly accusing us of causing the undead attacks. **Classic political maneuvering during a crisis.** They went after Vaerenth first, calling her a drunk. Then tried to implicate the whole party in the supernatural threats.

**I may have made things worse by successfully pickpocketing their leader.** And getting caught. In my defense, his purse was practically begging to be liberated, and sometimes you have to test whether rivals are competent enough to notice basic theft. Answer: barely.

But then Hart - this brilliant exile from some northern canopy settlement - asked the **perfect** question: **"Where were you when there was actual danger?"**

Critical success. **Crowd turned on the rivals instantly.** "Another drunkard!" they shouted, completely destroying the challengers' credibility. Hart and Vaerenth shared this epic high-five that probably sealed their friendship forever. **Even cosmic horror can't dampen the joy of watching perfectly executed social combat.**

Huntmaster Reese Blackwood handled the aftermath with admirable fairness - demanded I return the stolen gold (which I did, because honor matters even when dealing with incompetent rivals) but didn't punish the theft. **Then he gave us the mission that changes everything.**

**Craven Vakvom is not missing. He's hunting his own son.**

Nicholas revealed the horrible truth: his father, the former expedition leader who took Last Light's strongest defenders to Shulk Chasm and never returned, **personally attacked him with undead forces.** Not transformed. Not corrupted into something mindless. **Actively, deliberately hunting his own child.**

**This isn't a rescue mission anymore. It's an execution.**

The official story is still "search for Craven, save him if possible." But Blackwood's private admission - "I don't exactly believe that he lives" - combined with my oracle sight showing the true scope of threat... **We're going to kill a father who betrayed everything he once protected.**

**My companions handled the revelation better than I expected.** No panic about undead. No hesitation about crossing dangerous waters to reach Shulk Chasm. When I explained I'd been tracking an aetherweave-sensitive person and the trail led toward Last Light, they didn't dismiss it as madness. **They offered to help me continue the search.**

**That level of trust and acceptance... I'd forgotten what it felt like.**

We shared drinks and tea before launching the expedition (Augustus's idea - proper fellow, that one), and I found myself talking about Bright-Claw, about Whisper-Steps, about the terrible weight of necessary choices. **They understood.** Not the oracle sight, maybe never that, but the burden of doing what others can't or won't.

**For the first time in years, I'm not carrying this alone.**

The boat journey through Slithermarsh started peacefully enough. Time to process what we'd learned, plan our approach to Shulk Chasm, maybe even enjoy traveling with people who don't flinch when I shadow-step.

**Then we found Meyer's End.**

**Small laketown. Shambling townsfolk. Central pyre burning low and fading.**

**And that's a big problem.**

My scars are practically vibrating with warning. The way those people move... **not quite corrupted, not quite alive, not quite dead.** And that pyre - in the Age of Umbra, when Sacred Pyres keep the darkness at bay, a **dying flame** usually means something terrible is about to be unleashed.

**The oracle visions are clearer now.** I can see the threads connecting everything: Craven's betrayal, the undead in the marsh, this failing pyre, the aetherweave-sensitive person I've been tracking. **It's all part of something larger. Something that's been building while I was learning to trust again.**

**We're sitting in our boat, looking at Meyer's End with its Soggy Boot tavern and shambling inhabitants.** The pyre flickers. My scars pulse. My companions wait for guidance.

**Classic Age of Umbra moment: help the mysterious town with the dying protective fire, or continue to the mission that might prevent worse corruption from spreading?**

**Either way, we're not alone anymore.** Whatever horrors await in Meyer's End or Shulk Chasm, **we'll face them together.** And somehow, despite the cosmic threat pressing against reality's boundaries, despite Craven Vakvom's family-destroying betrayal, despite the dying pyre and shambling townsfolk...

**I find myself grinning.**

**Because tonight I learned that my new companions run toward screams instead of away from them. Because they trust a monster like me to watch their backs. Because when Hart asked that devastating question, she wasn't just destroying rivals - she was protecting our reputation and our mission.**

**Tomorrow we'll decide whether to investigate Meyer's End or push directly toward Shulk Chasm.** Tonight, **I'm going to enjoy being part of a team that actually understands what it means to stand between the darkness and the light.**

**My name is Captain Howling Banjo. I am the shadow between hope and despair. I am the oracle-touched guardian of reality itself.**

**And I am no longer alone in this fight.**

**Oh, and I definitely need to plan a proper prank involving their bedrolls and some strategically placed bioluminescent fungi from Thornhaven Reach.** **Some traditions really are sacred, even at the edge of cosmic horror.**

**Especially then.**
