## üé≠ Social Combat: Political Confrontation

### The Challenge
- **Rival Group**: Competing adventurers publicly challenged party's legitimacy
- **False Accusations**: Claimed Vaerenth was a drunkard, suggested party caused undead attacks
- **Public Setting**: Confrontation in front of crowd and Huntmaster Blackwood
- **Stakes**: Community trust and mission leadership

### The Victory
- **Vaerenth's Defense**: Successful Presence roll denying drinking accusations
- **Augustus's Resilience**: Defended against personal attacks with Presence roll
- **Hart's Devastating Question**: "Where were you when there was danger?" (Critical Success!)
- **Crowd Reversal**: Community shouted down rivals as "another drunkard"
- **Epic Celebration**: Hart & Vaerenth's triumphant high/low high five
- **Banjo's Gambit**: Successfully stole gold from challenger but was caught and returned it when ordered

### The Resolution
- **Rivals Defeated**: Challenger's group sulked back to the bar in humiliation
- **Blackwood's Authority**: Fair justice - demanded gold return but no punishment for Banjo
- **Mission Assignment**: Party officially chosen over rivals for Shalk Chasm expedition

## üéØ Official Mission: Hunt for Craven Vakvom

### Mission Parameters
- **Destination**: Shalk Chasm - formed by massive seismic event that opened underground catacombs
- **Time Limit**: One month expedition
- **Transportation**: Boat provided by Blackwood for water crossing through Slithermarsh
- **Supplies**: Meager supplies reflecting Last Light's resource constraints

### The Tragic Context
- **Craven Vakvom's Previous Expedition**: Led "Last Light's strongest men" to Shalk Chasm - none returned
- **Community Loss**: Settlement already lost valuable defenders to this mission
- **Blackwood's Doubts**: Privately admits he doesn't believe Craven actually lives
- **Safety Priority**: "Don't get yourselves killed over this"

### Mission Objectives
- **Primary**: "If Craven lives, do what you can to save him"
- **Secondary**: Gather supplies to help Last Light
- **Hidden Reality**: Party following same deadly path that claimed entire previous expedition

### üö® **CRITICAL REVELATION**
- **Nicholas's Truth**: Craven Vakvom **personally attacked his own son** with undead forces
- **Mission Reframe**: This is NOT a rescue - Craven is a confirmed hostile enemy

## üîÆ Looking Forward: Session 2 Setup

### Immediate Decision Point
**Party Status**: On boat in Slithermarsh, observing Meyer's End  
**Critical Choice**: Investigate dying pyre crisis or continue to Shalk Chasm

### Questions to Resolve
- Are the shambling townsfolk undead like the skeletons that attacked Nicholas?

- Can the party afford to help Meyer's End and still complete their primary mission?
