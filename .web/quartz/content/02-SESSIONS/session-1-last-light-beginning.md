## üö® CRITICAL REVELATIONS - Session 1 End

### ‚öîÔ∏è Nicholas's Attack - The Truth About Craven
- **SHOCKING DETAIL**: Nicholas specifically stated that **Craven personally attacked him**
- **Not Just "Back"**: Craven didn't just return - he actively assaulted his own son
- **Mission Reframe**: This is NOT a rescue mission - Craven is a confirmed hostile enemy
- **Family Horror**: Father deliberately attacking child with undead forces

### üî• Meyer's End Pyre Crisis
- **Critical Observation**: The central pyre is fading and going out
- **Major Problem**: This is described as "a big problem" - suggests the pyre serves a vital function
