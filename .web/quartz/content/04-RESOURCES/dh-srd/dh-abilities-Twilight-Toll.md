﻿# TWILIGHT TOLL

> **Level 9 Midnight Ability**  
> **Recall Cost:** 1

Choose a target within Far range. When you succeed on an action roll against them that doesn’t result in making a damage roll, place a token on this card. When you deal damage to this target, spend any number of tokens to add a d12 for each token spent to your damage roll. You can only hold Twilight Toll on one creature at a time.

When you choose a new target or take a rest, clear all unspent tokens.
