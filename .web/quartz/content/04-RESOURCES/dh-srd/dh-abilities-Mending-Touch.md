﻿# MENDING TOUCH

> **Level 1 Splendor Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 1

You lay your hands upon a creature and channel healing magic to close their wounds. When you can take a few minutes to focus on the target you’re helping, you can spend 2 Hope to clear a Hit Point or a Stress on them.

Once per long rest, when you spend this healing time learning something new about them or revealing something about yourself, you can clear 2 Hit Points or 2 Stress on them instead.
