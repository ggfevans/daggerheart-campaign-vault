﻿# FORCE OF NATURE

> **Level 10 Sage Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

Mark a Stress to transform into a hulking nature spirit, gaining the following benefits:

- When you succeed on an attack or Spellcast Roll, gain a +10 bonus to the damage roll.
- When you deal enough damage to defeat a creature within Close range, you absorb them and clear an Armor Slot.
- You can’t be Restrained.

Before you make an action roll, you must spend a Hope. If you can’t, you revert to your normal form.
