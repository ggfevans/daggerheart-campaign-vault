ï»¿# CALL OF THE BRAVE

Play the Call of the Brave if you want to use the might of your enemies to fuel your own power.

## FOUNDATION FEATURES

***Courage:*** When you fail a roll with Fear, you gain a Hope.

***Battle Ritual:*** Once per long rest, before you attempt something incredibly dangerous or face off against a foe who clearly outmatches you, describe what ritual you perform or preparations you make. When you do, clear 2 Stress and gain 2 Hope.

## SPECIALIZATION FEATURE

***Rise to the Challenge:*** You are vigilant in the face of mounting danger. While you have 2 or fewer Hit Points unmarked, you can roll a d20 as your Hope Die.

## MASTERY FEATURE

***Camaraderie:*** Your unwavering bravery is a rallying point for your allies. You can initiate a Tag Team Roll once per additional time per session. Additionally, when an ally initiates a Tag Team Roll with you, they only need to spend 2 Hope to do so.
