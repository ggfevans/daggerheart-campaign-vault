﻿# NOTORIOUS

> **Level 10 Grace Ability**  
> **Recall Cost:** 0

People know who you are and what you’ve done, and they treat you differently because of it. When you leverage your notoriety to get what you want, you can mark a Stress before you roll to gain a +10 bonus to the result. Your food and drinks are always free wherever you go, and everything else you buy is reduced in price by one bag of gold (to a minimum of one handful).

This card doesn’t count against your loadout’s domain card maximum of 5 and can’t be placed in your vault.
