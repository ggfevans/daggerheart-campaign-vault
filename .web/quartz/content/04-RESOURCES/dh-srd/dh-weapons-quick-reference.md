- **Tier 3 (Levels 5-7)**: "Advanced" versions with unique features
- **Tier 4 (Levels 8-10)**: "Legendary" versions with powerful abilities

## Secondary Weapons

Characters can dual-wield by choosing a one-handed primary weapon and a one-handed secondary weapon. Secondary weapons typically have lower damage but offer tactical options.

## Damage Calculation

Your damage roll = **Proficiency** + **Weapon Damage Dice**

- **Proficiency** at Level 1 = 1
- Example: Proficiency 1 + Weapon d6+1 = 1d6+1 damage

## Magic Weapons

All magic weapons require a **Spellcast trait**, determined by your subclass. Magic weapons deal magic damage and often have unique features tied to spellcasting.
