﻿# MASS DISGUISE

> **Level 6 Midnight Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 0

When you have a few minutes of silence to focus, you can mark a Stress to change the appearance of all willing creatures within Close range. Their new forms must share a general body structure and size, and can be somebody or something you’ve seen before or entirely fabricated. A disguised creature has advantage on Presence Rolls to avoid scrutiny.

Activate a Countdown (8). It ticks down as a consequence the GM chooses. When it triggers, the disguise drops.
