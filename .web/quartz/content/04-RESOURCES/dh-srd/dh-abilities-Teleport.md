﻿# TELEPORT

> **Level 5 Codex Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

Once per long rest, you can instantly teleport yourself and any number of willing targets within Close range to a place you’ve been before. Choose one of the following options, then make a Spellcast Roll (16):

- If you know the place very well, gain a +3 bonus.
- If you’ve visited the place frequently, gain a +1 bonus.
- If you’ve visited the place infrequently, gain no modifier.
- If you’ve only been there once, gain a -2 penalty.

On a success, you appear where you were intending to go. On a failure, you appear off course, with the range of failure determining how far off course.
