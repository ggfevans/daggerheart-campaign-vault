# COMMUNITIES

Communities represent a key aspect of the **culture, class, or environment of origin** that has had the most influence over your character’s upbringing.

Your character’s community grants them a **community feature.** Each community card also lists six adjectives you can use as inspiration to create your character’s personality, their relationship to their peers, their attitude toward their upbringing, or the demeanor with which they interact with the rest of the party.

**The 9 Communities are:**
