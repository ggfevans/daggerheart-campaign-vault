﻿# STUNNING SUNLIGHT

> **Level 8 Splendor Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

Make a Spellcast Roll to unleash powerful rays of burning sunlight against all adversaries in front of you within Far range. On a success, spend any number of Hope and force that many targets you succeeded against to make a Reaction Roll (14).

Targets who succeed take 3d20+3 magic damage. Targets who fail take 4d20+5 magic damage and are temporarily Stunned. While Stunned, they can’t use reactions and can’t take any other actions until they clear this condition.
