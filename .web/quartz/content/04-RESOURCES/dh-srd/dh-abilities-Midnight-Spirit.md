ï»¿# MIDNIGHT SPIRIT

> **Level 2 Midnight Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 1

Spend a Hope to summon a humanoid-sized spirit that can move or carry things for you until your next rest.

You can also send it to attack an adversary. When you do, make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Very Far range. On a success, the spirit moves into Melee range with that target. Roll a number of d6s equal to your Spellcast trait and deal that much magic damage to the target. The spirit then dissipates. You can only have one spirit at a time.
