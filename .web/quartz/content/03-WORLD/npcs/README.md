# NPCs Directory

This directory contains individual files for each Non-Player Character in the campaign.

## Organization
- Each NPC gets their own file: `npc-Name.md`
- Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., Reese-Blackwood.md`)
- Follow the NPC template from `99-CONFIG/templates/npc-template.md`

## Tagging Strategy
Each NPC file should include appropriate tags:
- `npc/[category]` - Type of NPC (major, minor, merchant, antagonist, etc.)
- `relationship/[status]` - ally, neutral, enemy, unknown
- `location/[where]` - Primary location
- `faction/[group]` - Organizational affiliation

## Quick Reference
For a complete list of all NPCs, search: `path:03-WORLD/npcs tag:npc/`
