## 💔 The Corruption & Death

### **The Infection Process**
**Gradual Onset**: Bright-Claw's corruption began subtly, starting with changes in appetite and sleep patterns that initially seemed like normal variations in a young simian's growth.

**Physical Transformation**: The corruption slowly twisted his simian features, elongating them in unnatural ways. His characteristic bright eyes turned black as the Umbra itself, filled with too many reflections and alien intelligence.

### **The Final Encounter**
**Location**: Bright-Claw's private grove in the outer canopy of Thornhaven Reach, where he had been hiding while feeding on community members.

**Tragic Recognition**: Despite the corruption's influence, some part of Bright-Claw remained aware enough to recognize Banjo, making the necessary execution emotionally devastating for both friends.

**The Death**: Killed by Banjo's precise dagger thrust, dying with a smile that suggested relief at being freed from the corruption's control. His final words hinted at understanding that his friend was performing an act of mercy.
