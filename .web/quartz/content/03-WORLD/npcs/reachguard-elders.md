**Collective Security**: Individual needs and desires are subordinate to community survival and safety.

**Purity Doctrine**: Strict rejection of anything deemed "unnatural" or potentially corrupting, particularly aether magic and outside influences.

**Consensus Building**: Preference for decisions that maintain community harmony and avoid internal conflict.

### Decision-Making Process
**Information Gathering**: Elders receive reports from scouts, crafters, and community members about issues requiring attention.

**Deliberation**: Private council sessions where Elders debate options based on traditional precedent and community welfare.

**Community Consultation**: For major decisions, Elders may hold public gatherings to hear community input (though final authority remains with the council).

**Implementation**: Decisions are communicated through established channels and enforced through community social pressure and, when necessary, formal sanctions.

## üé≠ Cultural Role & Traditions

### Community Leadership
**Moral Authority**: Elders serve as the final arbiters of community values and acceptable behavior.

**Crisis Management**: Take direct control during emergencies, with expanded authority to make rapid decisions affecting community survival.

**Ceremonial Functions**: Preside over important community rituals, celebrations, and life transitions.

### Traditional Practices
**The Crown Circle Meetings**: Regular gatherings in the highest branches of the Eldest Grove, emphasizing the Elders' connection to the natural world.

**Judgment Circles**: Formal proceedings for addressing serious violations of community law or tradition.

**Wisdom Sharing**: Regular sessions where Elders share knowledge with younger community members, ensuring continuity of traditional practices.

**Seasonal Councils**: Special meetings aligned with natural cycles to address long-term planning and resource management.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Security & Defense Authority

### Scout Oversight
**Command Authority**: Elders have ultimate authority over scout caste operations and protocols.

**Mission Approval**: All scout activities beyond routine patrols must be approved by the council.

**Training Standards**: Elders set requirements for scout training and determine who is qualified for scout caste membership.

**Disciplinary Action**: Handle violations of scout protocols and determine appropriate sanctions.

### Threat Response
**Assessment Protocol**: Elders evaluate all reported threats and determine appropriate community response.

**Resource Allocation**: Decide how community resources should be used for defense and security measures.

**Emergency Powers**: During crises, Elders can suspend normal procedures and implement emergency protocols.

**External Relations**: Make all decisions about contact with outsiders and responses to external threats.

## üéØ The Banjo Incident

### The Corruption Crisis
**Initial Response**: When corruption was discovered within the community, Elders demanded adherence to established protocols for investigation and containment.

**Protocol Conflict**: Banjo's immediate action to eliminate corrupted individuals violated community procedures requiring Elder approval for such decisions.

**Aether Revelation**: Discovery of Banjo's shadow-stepping abilities confirmed Elder suspicions about aether magic being inherently corrupting.

### The Exile Decision
**Formal Charges**: Banjo was accused of:
- Unauthorized use of "corrupting" aether magic
- Murder of community members without proper authority
- Violation of scout caste protocols
- Endangering community security through reckless action

**Council Deliberation**: Elders debated whether Banjo's actions saved the community or represented a corruption threat requiring elimination.

**Final Verdict**: Unanimous decision to exile Banjo as a corrupted individual who posed an ongoing threat to community purity and safety.

**Justification**: Elders cited traditional law, the community's survival success through avoiding "unnatural" practices, and the need to maintain unity and authority.

### Ongoing Pursuit
**Manhunt Authorization**: Elders have authorized scout patrols to track and apprehend Banjo for justice.

**Community Safety**: Continued concern that Banjo's corruption might spread to other communities or lead threats back to Thornhaven Reach.

**Precedent Maintenance**: Need to demonstrate that community law applies to everyone, regardless of individual abilities or past service.

## üîó Current Relationships

### Internal Dynamics
**Community Support**: Most community members support the Elders' decision, trusting their traditional authority and sharing concerns about corruption.

**Silent Opposition**: Some community members privately question the exile, particularly those who knew Banjo personally or witnessed the corruption threat firsthand.

**Scout Loyalty**: Reformed scout caste demonstrates renewed commitment to Elder authority and traditional protocols.

### External Connections
**[[captain-howling-banjo-sheet|Banjo]]**: Now considered a dangerous exile who must be brought to justice for the safety of the community.

**Other Communities**: Potential warnings to allied enclaves about Banjo's "corruption" and dangerous abilities.

**Surface Threats**: Continued focus on traditional external threats while managing the internal crisis caused by Banjo's actions.

## üìù Story Hooks & Plot Potential

### Immediate Conflicts
**The Hunt Continues**: Elder-authorized scouts tracking Banjo create ongoing tension and potential confrontations.

**Community Division**: Hidden supporters of Banjo might attempt to contact him or even leave the community.

**New Corruption**: If corruption reappears in Thornhaven Reach, it would challenge the Elders' decision-making and potentially vindicate Banjo's methods.

### Long-term Developments
**Authority Crisis**: Younger community members might begin questioning traditional Elder authority in the face of changing world conditions.

**Survival Challenges**: Age of Umbra threats might intensify beyond what traditional methods can handle, requiring reconsideration of "unnatural" solutions.

**Reconciliation Opportunity**: Crisis situations might force Elders to choose between pride and community survival, potentially leading to Banjo's rehabilitation.

### Character Development
**Moral Complexity**: Elders genuinely believe their decisions protect the community, creating sympathetic antagonists rather than simple villains.

**Traditional vs. Innovation**: Conflict between established ways and adaptive solutions reflects broader themes about survival in changing times.

**Leadership Burden**: Individual Elders might struggle with doubt about their decisions while maintaining public unity and authority.
