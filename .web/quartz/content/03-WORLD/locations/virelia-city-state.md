# Virelia - The Ailing City-State

## üèõÔ∏è Overview
Virelia is a sophisticated but declining city-state where **"silver tongues and silent daggers keep court in equal measure."** Once a center of political unity and cultural refinement, it has devolved into a hotbed of sophisticated political warfare following the collapse of the Grand Order.
