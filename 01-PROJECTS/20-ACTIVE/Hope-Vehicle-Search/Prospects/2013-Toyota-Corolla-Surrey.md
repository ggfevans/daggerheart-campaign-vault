**Mileage:** 252,000 km
**Transmission:** Automatic (4-speed traditional automatic - CONFIRMED GOOD)
**Seller:** Govind Singh (Joined Facebook 2015)

## Initial Assessment Summary

**Verdict: Proceed with caution - Requires thorough inspection**

This 2013 Corolla appears to be a decent prospect that aligns with several of your criteria:
- ✅ **Traditional automatic transmission** (4-speed, highly reliable)
- ✅ Within budget range (leaves room for taxes and inspection)
- ✅ Toyota reliability reputation
- ⚠️ Higher mileage than ideal (252,000 km vs recommended 180k-200k)
- ⚠️ Limited information provided in listing

## Detailed Analysis

### Transmission Assessment
**Great news!** The 2013 Corolla uses Toyota's proven 4-speed automatic transmission (U340E/U341E), one of the most reliable automatics ever produced. This is NOT a CVT - Toyota didn't introduce CVT to Corolla until 2014. This transmission typically lasts 300,000-400,000 km with proper maintenance.

### Pricing Analysis
- **Asking Price:** $8,500
- **Fair Market Value:** $7,000-$8,500 for this mileage
- **Assessment:** Priced at the upper end of fair value
- **Negotiation Target:** $7,500-$7,800 (10-15% reduction justified by mileage)

### Total Cost Breakdown
```
Vehicle Price:        $8,500 (asking)
PST (12%):           $1,020
Registration:        $50
Professional Inspection: $200
Total:              $9,770
```

Leaves $230 buffer for immediate repairs - **very tight margin**.

### Fuel Economy for Your Commute
- **Expected:** 6.5L/100km combined
- **Annual Fuel Cost:** ~$600 (Yale-Hope daily commute)
- **Monthly Cost:** ~$75 (fuel + maintenance)

### Known Issues for 2013 Corolla
1. **Oil consumption** - Some 2013 models affected (check service records)
2. **Water pump** - May need replacement around 250,000 km ($400-600)
3. **Suspension components** - Struts/shocks likely original at this mileage
4. **Battery** - Check age, may need replacement soon

### Red Flags in This Listing
1. **Minimal description** - "Clean title, good tires, excellent condition, no issues" is vague
2. **No service history mentioned** - Critical at 252,000 km
3. **Location discrepancy** - Listed 3 weeks ago, seller might be motivated
4. **High mileage** - 52,000 km above your target range

### Strengths
1. **Bulletproof transmission** - 4-speed auto is Toyota's most reliable
2. **2013 model year** - Avoids 2009-2010 oil consumption issues
3. **Grey color** - Hides dirt/scratches well for trail access roads
4. **2 owners** - Reasonable for age
5. **Fuel efficiency champion** - Best economy of your target vehicles

## Inspection Priorities

### Must-Check Items
1. **Oil consumption test** - Check oil level before and after test drive
2. **Transmission fluid** - Should be bright red, not brown
3. **CV joints** - Listen for clicking on full-lock turns
4. **Suspension** - Bounce test, listen for clunks
5. **Service records** - Especially transmission services

### Test Drive Focus
1. **Cold start** - Any rough idle or engine noise
2. **Transmission shifts** - Should be smooth through all gears
3. **Highway acceleration** - Adequate power for Fraser Canyon hills
4. **Brake performance** - Especially important for mountain driving
5. **Heat/AC function** - Critical for winter commuting

## Questions for Seller

1. "Do you have service records, especially for transmission services?"
2. "Has the timing chain been serviced?" (Due around 250,000 km)
3. "Any oil consumption between oil changes?"
4. "Why are you selling?" (Listed 3 weeks - why hasn't it sold?)
5. "Would you accept $7,500 cash after inspection passes?"

## Negotiation Strategy

### Opening Offer: $7,200
**Justification:**
- Mileage 25% above typical (252k vs 200k)
- No service records mentioned
- Approaching major service intervals
- Cash buyer, quick close

### Walk-Away Price: $8,000
If seller won't budge below $8,000, the tight budget margin makes this too risky.

## Action Plan

1. **Message seller** requesting:
   - Service history documentation
   - Specific transmission service dates
   - Willingness to meet at Hope RCMP for inspection

2. **If positive response:**
   - Schedule CarInspect mobile inspection
   - Arrange test drive focused on transmission
   - Bring mechanic's stethoscope for engine listening

3. **If inspection passes:**
   - Negotiate based on findings
   - Verify at seller's bank
   - Complete at ICBC immediately

## Comparison to Recommended Vehicles

### vs 2012-2013 Forester
- **Corolla Pros:** Better fuel economy ($600 vs $770/year), bulletproof transmission
- **Corolla Cons:** No trail capability, less winter confidence
- **Verdict:** Corolla wins if trail access not critical

### vs 2013 Civic
- **Corolla Pros:** Slightly roomier, softer ride
- **Civic Pros:** Sportier handling, potentially lower mileage examples
- **Verdict:** Equal reliability, personal preference

## Fraser Canyon Suitability

**Strengths:**
- Reliable for daily commuting
- Excellent fuel economy
- Good winter tires = adequate winter capability

**Limitations:**
- **No trail access** - FSR capability zero
- **Less winter confidence** - FWD only, lower ground clearance
- **Hill climbing** - Adequate but not powerful

## Final Recommendation

**Proceed with inspection IF:**
- Seller provides service history
- Willing to negotiate to $7,500-$7,800 range
- You're OK sacrificing trail access for reliability/economy

**Walk away IF:**
- No service records available
- Seller inflexible on price
- Oil consumption issues discovered
- You need any trail/FSR capability

This could be a reliable commuter, but the high mileage and lack of trail capability make it a compromise choice. The bulletproof transmission is a major plus, but ensure thorough inspection given the mileage.
