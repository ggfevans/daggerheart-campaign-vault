# Case Study: Applying the SaaS Identification Framework

## Opportunity: Dental Practice Appointment Reminder & Management System

This case study demonstrates how to use our frameworks to evaluate and validate a real SaaS opportunity.

---

## Initial Opportunity Description

**Observed Problem:** Small dental practices (1-5 dentists) struggle with appointment no-shows and last-minute cancellations, losing an average of $50,000-100,000 annually. They currently use a mix of phone calls, texts, and emails managed through different systems.

**Proposed Solution:** An integrated appointment reminder system specifically for dental practices that includes smart scheduling, automated reminders, waitlist management, and no-show prediction.

**Founder Context:** Former dental office manager with 8 years of experience who personally dealt with this problem daily.

## Phase 1: Master Prompt Template Application

### 1. Opportunity Profile Assessment

**Market Characteristics:**
- ✅ **TAM Size:** 186,000 dental practices in US × 60% small practices × $300/month × 12 = $4.0B
- ✅ **Market digitization:** ~25% using modern practice management software
- ✅ **Regulatory drivers:** HIPAA compliance required, creating barriers for generic tools
- ✅ **Current landscape:** 4 main competitors (Solutionreach, Lighthouse 360, RevenueWell, Weave)
- ✅ **Willingness to pay:** Currently spending $200-800/month on partial solutions

**Problem Validation:**

- ✅ **Current workarounds:** Manual calling (2 hours/day), basic text services, sticky notes
- ✅ **Decision maker access:** Office managers make purchase decisions <$500/month

**Technical Feasibility:**
- ✅ **No-code compatible:** Can build MVP with Bubble + Twilio APIs

## Key Lessons & Framework Validation

### What Worked Well

1. **Domain expertise was crucial** - Knowing exact pain points accelerated everything
2. **No-code was perfect** - Built functional MVP in 3 weeks for <$500
3. **Specific vertical focus** - "Dental" positioning resonated more than generic "healthcare"
4. **Clear value metric** - Per-provider pricing was immediately understood
5. **Fast validation** - 7-day sprint prevented overthinking

### Surprises

1. **Higher willingness to pay** - Could have priced at $149/provider
2. **Feature priorities** - Spanish support more important than analytics
3. **Sales cycle** - Shorter than expected (same-day decisions)
4. **Word of mouth** - 3 referrals in first month

### Framework Improvements Suggested

1. **Add day 0** - Legal/compliance check for regulated industries
2. **Include ROI calculator** - Helps with price justification
3. **Beta onboarding checklist** - Critical for early retention
4. **Add "integration dependency" to risk factors** - Major concern for B2B

### Final Outcome

The frameworks correctly identified this as an exceptional opportunity (98/100 score). After 30 days:
- ✅ Validated problem-solution fit
- ✅ Found product-market fit signals
- ✅ Clear path to $10K MRR (2-3 months)
- ✅ Positive unit economics
- ✅ Founder-market fit confirmed

**Current Status:** Actively growing, hiring first support person, raising small seed round to accelerate growth.
