## üéØ Campaign Relevance
The Apostasy is the foundational catastrophic event that created the current state of the [[halcyon-domain-geography|Halcyon Domain]]. Understanding this event is crucial for grasping why the world is as it is, the nature of divine abandonment, and the origins of [[umbra-corruption|the Umbra]].

## üìñ The Great Abandonment

### What Happened
**Over a century ago**, a catastrophic event occurred that fundamentally altered the relationship between the divine and mortal realms in the [[halcyon-domain-geography|Halcyon Domain]].

### Key Players
- **God-King Othedias**: The mortal ruler who somehow disappointed the gods
- **The Veiled Gods**: The divine beings who had previously protected and guided the realm
- **The Enduring**: Survivors of the divine retaliation and abandonment

### The Sequence of Events
1. **Divine Disappointment**: God-King Othedias committed some act or decision that deeply disappointed the **Veiled Gods**
2. **Divine Retaliation**: The gods struck back against the mortals in anger
3. **Complete Abandonment**: The **Veiled Gods** withdrew entirely from the mortal realm
4. **Aftermath**: The realm was left to face corruption and decay without divine protection

## üî• Immediate Consequences
