# Age of Umbra Overview

## üìö Official Sources
- **Daggerheart Core Rule Book**: Campaign frame designed by Matthew Mercer
- **Critical Role Miniseries**: 8-part survival fantasy series (May-July 2025)
- **Critical Role Wiki**: [Age of Umbra](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Age_of_Umbra) and [Halcyon Domain](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Realms_of_Daggerheart#Halcyon_Domain)

## üéØ Campaign Relevance
The Age of Umbra serves as the foundational setting for our Daggerheart campaign, providing the dark, survival-focused backdrop against which our heroes' stories unfold in [[Desperloch]] and the broader [[halcyon-domain-geography|Halcyon Domain]].

## üìñ Core Concept

The Age of Umbra is a **dark survival fantasy** campaign frame set in the [[halcyon-domain-geography|Halcyon Domain]], a realm abandoned by the gods over a century ago. This world embodies themes of **apocalypse, corruption, darkness vs. light, hope, redemption, and survival**.

### The Great Abandonment
Over a century ago, the **God-King Othedias** disappointed the **Veiled Gods**, causing an event known as **the Apostasy**. In retaliation, the deities abandoned the mortal realm, leaving survivors to face a corrupted world alone.

### The Umbra Threat
A **dark, ethereal mass known as the Umbra** now roams the land, corrupting everything it touches and reanimating the dead into twisted, nightmarish forms. This shadowy menace transforms fallen souls into **fiendish monstrosities** that serve its malevolent will.

### Sacred Pyres - Beacons of Hope
Communities survive by gathering around **[[sacred-pyres|Sacred Pyres]]** - divine flames that burn slowly and keep the Umbra at bay. These flames are lit from "Blessed Branches" and cannot be extinguished by ordinary weather, though enough blood can put them out.
