# Magic in the Age of Umbra

## üìö Official Sources
- **Daggerheart Core Rule Book**: Age of Umbra campaign frame social dynamics
- **Critical Role Wiki**: [Halcyon Domain](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Realms_of_Daggerheart#Halcyon_Domain)
- **Age of Umbra Miniseries**: Referenced in character creation and social interactions

## üéØ Campaign Relevance
Understanding the social position of magic users is crucial for roleplaying, party dynamics, and community interactions in our campaign. The tension around magical practice affects character development, NPC relationships, and the overall atmosphere of mistrust and survival.

## üé≠ Social Position of Spellcasters

### The Title: Aetherweavers
Magic users in the [[halcyon-domain-geography|Halcyon Domain]] are known as **"Aetherweavers"** rather than traditional terms like wizards, sorcerers, or mages. This terminology reflects:
- **Elemental Connection**: Emphasis on manipulating fundamental forces
- **Weaving Metaphor**: Magic as crafting or binding rather than commanding
- **Cultural Distinction**: Separate identity from pre-Apostasy magic traditions
- **Technical Precision**: Specific skill set rather than general arcane power

### Deep Suspicion and Mistrust
Aetherweavers face **significant social challenges** due to widespread suspicion:
- **Divine Association**: Magic is linked to the forces that caused **[[the-apostasy|the Apostasy]]**
- **Corruption Fear**: Concern that magical practice might attract **[[umbra-corruption|Umbra]]** attention
- **Historical Trauma**: Community memory of magical powers contributing to divine abandonment
- **Scapegoat Tendency**: Easy targets for blame when things go wrong

### Paradoxical Usefulness
Despite suspicion, Aetherweavers provide **essential services**:
- **Community Protection**: Magical defenses supplement **[[sacred-pyres|Sacred Pyre]]** protection
- **Practical Solutions**: Magical healing, communication, and utility spells
- **Specialized Knowledge**: Understanding of supernatural threats and phenomena
- **Emergency Resources**: Capabilities unavailable through mundane means

## üèõÔ∏è Historical Context

### Pre-Apostasy Magic
Before **[[the-apostasy|the Apostasy]]**, magic likely held a different social position:
- **Divine Approval**: Magical practice may have been blessed or endorsed by the [[veiled-gods|Veiled Gods]]
- **Institutional Support**: Formal training and recognition within the God-King's system
- **Social Integration**: Magic users as respected members of society
- **Abundant Resources**: Divine connection making magical practice easier and more reliable

### The Apostasy's Impact on Magic
The divine abandonment fundamentally altered magical practice:
- **Power Source Questions**: Uncertainty about where magical power now originates
- **Effectiveness Changes**: Possible reduction in magical potency or reliability
- **Moral Ambiguity**: Questions about whether using magic contributes to ongoing problems
- **Knowledge Loss**: Disruption of magical education and tradition preservation

### Contemporary Adaptation
Current magical practice has evolved to reflect new realities:
- **Survival Focus**: Magic prioritized for practical survival needs
- **Secretive Practice**: Many Aetherweavers hide their abilities to avoid persecution
- **Community Service**: Proving value through concrete assistance to settlements
- **Defensive Emphasis**: Specialization in protection against corruption and monsters

## ü§ù Community Relationships

Communities maintain complex relationships with Aetherweavers:
- **Grudging Acceptance**: Recognizing magical assistance as essential for survival
- **Conditional Welcome**: Magic users accepted if they prove their value and loyalty

### Social Restrictions
Aetherweavers often face informal but significant limitations:
- **Public Practice**: Pressure to avoid obvious magical displays

### Trust Building Strategies
Successful Aetherweavers develop approaches to gain community acceptance:
- **Transparent Practice**: Open about magical abilities and their limitations
